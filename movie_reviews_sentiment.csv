"I just got out of The BatmanThis movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said ""This is a masterpiece"" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!I was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.",got batmanthis movie really everyone easily darkest batman movie yet gritty depressing fun movie usual comic book movie detective movie common se en previous batman movie first two third movie amazing one point turned son said masterpiece everything work brilliant enthralled boy drop ball final act cast pattinson great collin farrell ok zoe kravitz fine zero chemistry pattinson keaton pfeiffer paul dano though incredible especially scene arkham whilst geoffrey wright great always downside pacing issue really long though sure cut really keen ending know comic book storyline think final act really let movie final act feel movie run time surprised people screening,positive,2
"I have been absolutely fizzing to see 'The Batman' from the day it was announced, but even more so from when I first heard it described as being inspired by 'Se7en' - one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time. Were we finally going to get the raw and gritty Batman film I'd always dreamed of seeing? We certainly were.Where to begin? The biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with Batman, as Batman. There is very little of Bruce Wayne in this movie and I'm absolutely fine with that. The movie is Batman's story and we are with him from start to finish. We even get some narration from him, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about just yet. It was very good narration but I'm not sure he's a character I want it from.The Riddler in this movie is phenomenal. After The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' this is absolutely my second favourite Batman film villain. He was clearly inspired by the Zodiac killer and what an inspired choice. Also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius. These are very clever riddles and puzzles and make Batman have to do some serious detective work - something I've always wanted more of from him in the previous films.This is my favourite incarnation of Catwoman to date. I haven't loved her character's place in the films in the past. I've found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of Batman that I haven't enjoyed. In this film though she was used perfectly. She's the love interest and a villain/anti-hero all in one. That is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a Batman film - the pointless love interest.The Penguin was probably the one letdown for me. From what I'd seen in the trailer I suspected this may be the case. I'm wondering if they were using this movie as a set-up for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do. In this one though I just found him quite a dull screen-presence.Robert Pattinson as Batman blew me away. He looked great and his voice was perfect. He was extremely intense and very menacing. Even though I knew he was more than capable of playing the role, I think I still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes. He absolutely did and then some.The film has quite a unique feel. There are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both Tim Burton's Batman universe and Christopher Nolan's universe. But then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of 'The Batman'. It basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into it's own style - while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also. It's very well done in that sense.The Batmobile in this movie is awesome. There's just no other way to put it. The sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bone-chilling. The chase sequence in this movie with The Penguin is one of the best I've ever seen.The film is long at just under 3 hours but it really never feels like it. There's a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while. That really is the only flat part of the movie however. The rest happens at a break-neck pace.It's hard to find enough good things to say about this movie. I need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer, but for now I have it firmly sitting in second place behind 'The Dark Knight' in my order of favourite Batman films. 10/10.",absolutely fizzing see batman day announced even first heard described inspired se en one favourite psychological thriller time finally going get raw gritty batman film always dreamed seeing certainly begin biggest thing struck film much time got spend batman batman little bruce wayne movie absolutely fine movie batman story start finish even get narration quite sure feel yet good narration sure character want riddler movie phenomenal joker dark knight absolutely second favourite batman film villain clearly inspired zodiac killer inspired choice also use riddle film nothing short genius clever riddle puzzle make batman serious detective work something always wanted previous film favourite incarnation catwoman date loved character place film past found slows everything brings dull side batman enjoyed film though used perfectly love interest villain anti hero one massive save another thing often bog batman film pointless love interest penguin probably one letdown seen trailer suspected may case wondering using movie set second film evolve lot one though found quite dull screen presence robert pattinson batman blew away looked great voice perfect extremely intense menacing even though knew capable playing role think still needed see end product confirmation take absolutely film quite unique feel scene sequence film would feel place tim burton batman universe christopher nolan universe little aspect respective film clearly inspired part batman basically took best thing twisted style obviously adding lot stuff also well done sense batmobile movie awesome way put sound made vibration sent cinema chair bone chilling chase sequence movie penguin one best ever seen film long hour really never feel like short period middle movie everything slows little really flat part movie however rest happens break neck pace hard find enough good thing say movie need see digest couple thing little longer firmly sitting second place behind dark knight order favourite batman film,positive,3
"Matt Reeves' long-awaited Batman reboot has in many ways become a magnificent, epic spectacle, with its dark, brooding version of Gotham, a pessimistic, haunted Batman as realized by Robert Pattinson, and an intricate, Zodiac inspired take on his main antagonist Riddler. But despite a relatively wide variation of themes and having the shell of a really good movie, The Batman slowly gets itself lost in sluggish power struggles, vapid social commentary, various allusions to original sin, and a promised showdown which turns out to be no more then a preface to the next episode of a prospective series. Pattinson's uninspired voice-over in the beginning and the end reveals that this Batman hasn't really learned anything or developed during the movie's far too indulgent running time, despite extensive soul-searching, ostensibly. He has just altered his justification for his actions. Not for the first time in Batman history, the villains are far more interesting than the hero. Paul Dano's wonderful performance makes Riddler a layered, fascinating specimen. And there are also delightful supporting work from Peter Sarsgaard as a tragic, corrupt district attorney, and an unrecognizable Colin Farrell as Penguin.",matt reef long awaited batman reboot many way become magnificent epic spectacle dark brooding version gotham pessimistic haunted batman realized robert pattinson intricate zodiac inspired take main antagonist riddler despite relatively wide variation theme shell really good movie batman slowly get lost sluggish power struggle vapid social commentary various allusion original sin promised showdown turn preface next episode prospective series pattinson uninspired voice beginning end reveals batman really learned anything developed movie far indulgent running time despite extensive soul searching ostensibly altered justification action first time batman history villain far interesting hero paul dano wonderful performance make riddler layered fascinating specimen also delightful supporting work peter sarsgaard tragic corrupt district attorney unrecognizable colin farrell penguin,positive,4
"The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language.

"Everything about this movie is trying too hard - the over dramatic score, the long shots on characters faces, the overacting, the complex crime story - it all feels like it's trying to get an Oscar in every moment.It's overly long, drawn out, and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the Batman universe shoehorned into it.This movie is not a masterpiece, but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is!",everything movie trying hard dramatic score long shot character face overacting complex crime story feel like trying get oscar every moment overly long drawn story feel like generic crime saga batman universe shoehorned movie masterpiece spends lot effort making think,negative,6
"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulGotham City is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures, by a sadistic killer calling himself The Riddler (Paul Dano), who holds the city to ransom, revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped. 'The Batman' (Robert Pattinson), the alter ego of millionaire Bruce Wayne, starts an investigation of his own, crossing paths with a woman called Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), who operates as 'Catwoman' and wants to find out what happened to her friend. It sets them both on a collision course with the darkest elements of Gotham's underworld, including notorious gangster 'The Penguin' (an unrecognisable Colin Farrell) and crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who may be sitting on a devastating secret that could shatter both their lives.The Batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films, appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation. Here, writer/director Matt Reeves delivers a mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever. Less doesn't seem to be more anymore, at least not to the cinema artistes, but from this end, all I can see is a film drowning in its own indulgence.Reeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak, heavy tone established by Christopher Nolan, and so we have a Gotham City with seemingly endless heavy rain, and gloomy skies, set against Pattinson's dark, brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers, set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack. It's just one of many things ripe for parody in a film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light. Even more overdone is Dano's dark 'Riddler', operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous. Thrown in to this is the topical 'social justice' speeches that litter film and TV today, with Kravitz's Catwoman even praising the 'sinister' villain (who we're meant to hate!) at one point, for killing 'all these white privileged a$$holes.' It's just trying to cram a whole load of eggs in to one basket, over ambitious and overlong, and by the time of the main villain's grand 'master plan' at the end, you're too overwhelmed (or bored) to care.Everyone else can think what they like, but personally this is one of the most pretentious Batman's ever, which might have been a bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent, or at least had an old fashioned, Lawrence of Arabia style 'intermission' at some point. **",star rating brilliant good okay poor awfulgotham city rocked series murder key political figure sadistic killer calling riddler paul dano hold city ransom revealing darkly guarded secret threatening mayhem stopped batman robert pattinson alter ego millionaire bruce wayne start investigation crossing path woman called selina kyle zoe kravitz operates catwoman want find happened friend set collision course darkest element gotham underworld including notorious gangster penguin unrecognisable colin farrell crime bos carmine falcone john turturro may sitting devastating secret could shatter life batman series must one enduringly successful franchise world comic book film appearing various different incarnation since original creation writer director matt reef delivers mammoth three hour long interpretation character many seem hailing best ever le seem anymore least cinema artiste end see film drowning indulgence reef obviously keen maintain bleak heavy tone established christopher nolan gotham city seemingly endless heavy rain gloomy sky set pattinson dark brooding stare gravelly voiceovers set background emo rock soundtrack one many thing ripe parody film take much seriously feel almost devoid humour light even overdone dano dark riddler operating garish gimp suit look ridiculous thrown topical social justice speech litter film tv today kravitz catwoman even praising sinister villain meant hate one point killing white privileged hole trying cram whole load egg one basket ambitious overlong time main villain grand master plan end overwhelmed bored care everyone else think like personally one pretentious batman ever might bit bearable le self indulgent least old fashioned lawrence arabia style intermission point,negative,7
"I'm not sure where to begin as I don't generally want to spoil the reveals, but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic. For 'The Batman'; Matt Reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as 'Batman: Year One', 'Hush', and 'Batman: The Long Halloween'. Reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as 'The French Connection', 'Zodiac', and the noir classic 'Chinatown'. The general feel of the movie sought to relate Batman in the detective role that he's famous for in the comics, but unfortunately ignores any attempt at Batman's level of crime & mystery.The acting was really good. There's a great cast of professionals in this film, although Robert Patterson isn't allowed a range of emotion. Bruce Wayne and Batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emo-kid who walks through life with severe lethargy. Colin Farrell is unrecognizable as the Penguin, and dare I say gave the greatest performance of his life. A large portion of the film is writing out a semi-origin story for Oswald Cobblepot and his rise to become Gotham's crime boss. A lot of the villains are the origin stories here. Batman (the character) is basically introduced the way he is in 'Batman: Year Two' and I thought that was a mistake. Year one of Batman would have been wonderful on screen. The audience seeing Bruce Wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movie's ""Everyone is just scared of him."" plot device. Zoe Kravitz's performance as Selena Kyle becoming Cat Woman was under-developed, as she was so much fun to watch in 'The Batman' that I'd like to see this spin-off into a stand-alone Cat Woman release. Jeffery Wright was brilliant (of course) even remaining quiet in the Batman's background he pulled the attention onto himself, mostly because Patterson's portrayal was incredibly stiff. Paul Dano as The Riddler was exactly what I wanted to see in this movie. The character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer, but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with Carmine Falcone. John Turturro was great as the crime boss Falcone, but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings. It dragged on so long that it bored me completely. I went into 'The Batman' to see him match wits with a clever serial killer, not be re-educated about the connection between Thomas Wayne & Carmine Falcone again.The action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way. I knew before hand that Reeves lifted from some older better known films, but it's as if they dropped the budget on these scenes. Batman racing to catch the Penguin was an old muscle car Batmobile versus (what I'm guessing was) a 1980's Buick. I was laughing at this chase scene... it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if Penguin were in an expensive Italian sports car, I might have enjoyed it. But it was literally a supped-up car desperately trying to out pace my mom's car. The fighting was dull. Hand to hand combat is one of the first things Bruce Wayne learns before donning the cowl. But in this movie Batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at. So much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills, that I wondered where the editor was.'The Batman' is simply too long. It's a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of it's own significance. It fails at cohesive story-telling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score.

"Matt Reeves The Batman is a hell of a movie, it is the darkest live action Batman movie ever made, and the longest one too, The Batman fills with a top notch action sequence that not only exciting, but it's cinematic too, the cinematography was just incredible, Michael Giacchino The Batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever, it's enduringly great, the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when Batman shows up, it really making me hyped more because of that, Colin Farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as The Penguin, Paul Dano performance is giving me a Heath Ledger Joker vibes but not trying to be Heath Ledger Joker which is still great, Paul Dano The Riddler is still a terrifying and a very disturbing villain, Zoe Kravits performances as Catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer, and the Catwoman fighting sequence is definitely a win for Zoe and i did still like her a lot in here, and in the end we got The Batman himself, Robert Pattinson, all i can say about him as The Batman is that i hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play The Batman which is a really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible Twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome Batman, now he was become my second favorite Batman next to Christian Bale in number one still, the story of The Batman itself is great, and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite a lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow, it's not boring but i feel like they can make it a little bit faster, if it's only one or two or three scene i probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that, but at in the end The Batman is still a hell of a great movie, it's still amazing and it's still incredible, i was impress by most of the thing that happens, i was excited, i was hyped, i was stunt by all the amazing thing that they've done, The Batman is fire!!!.",matt reef batman hell movie darkest live action batman movie ever made longest one batman fill top notch action sequence exciting cinematic cinematography incredible michael giacchino batman theme song become one favorite movie theme song ever enduringly great action perfect without theme making even perfect theme background especially batman show really making hyped colin farrell transformation amazing performance penguin paul dano performance giving heath ledger joker vibe trying heath ledger joker still great paul dano riddler still terrifying disturbing villain zoe kravits performance catwoman amazing though wild michelle pfeiffer batman return boy gesture look wild michelle pfeiffer catwoman fighting sequence definitely win zoe still like lot end got batman robert pattinson say batman hope everybody starting know guy play batman really good movie guy play horrible twilight film anymore indeed awesome batman become second favorite batman next christian bale number one still story batman great problem movie quite lot particular scene slow slow boring feel like make little bit faster one two three scene probably still forgive unfortunately happens end batman still hell great movie still amazing still incredible impress thing happens excited hyped stunt amazing thing done batman fire,positive,9

It's super dark and grounded in reality, even more than the Nolan trilogy. And it feels true to the character. Zoe Kravitz and Jeffrey Wright are great casting choices. It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.At the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me. I did not connect with the characters, especially the villain. The relationships seem undeveloped and not organic. I was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as I should have been.

"I will say I liked the story, but the long dragged out and slowly paced near 3 hours was ridiculous. You could watch this at 1.5x speed and it would be more enjoyable. This needed at least 20 mins cut out and much faster storytelling. And the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fast.I do like Pattinson as an actor, but not as Batman in this one. He wasn't convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and Emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy. And that's him both as Batman and even more so as Bruce Wayne.And what's with Colin Farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the Penguin? Was every other actor that naturally has that character's look unavailable? It's not like Farrell has a particular set of Penguin skills lol. Casting Farrell as Batman and Pattinson as Penguin, now that would've worked much better imo.I'm also a big fan of Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, but here again, he was very unconvincing as Gordon, especially when he also had that monotonic whispering Emo demeanor. I get that director and joint writer Reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme, but instead, the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throats.The only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful Kravitz, who stole the entire show. I would've rather watched a 4+ hour movie with just her as Catwoman.All the Affleck, Keaton, Bale, Kilmer and even Clooney Batman characters were much more convincing, as well as having more and better ""keep you awake"" action in said films.Sadly, this one is a generous yet disappointing 6/10 from me.",say liked story long dragged slowly paced near hour ridiculous could watch x speed would enjoyable needed least min cut much faster storytelling constant whisper dialogue film became annoying really fast like pattinson actor batman one convincing monotonic whispering dialogue emo demeanor lackluster point cringeworthy batman even bruce wayne colin farrell cast prosthetics play penguin every actor naturally character look unavailable like farrell particular set penguin skill lol casting farrell batman pattinson penguin would worked much better imo also big fan westworld jeffrey wright unconvincing gordon especially also monotonic whispering emo demeanor get director joint writer reef going dark lonely dreary theme instead character looked bored inexperienced actor sore throat one nailed character perfectly lovely beautiful kravitz stole entire show would rather watched hour movie catwoman affleck keaton bale kilmer even clooney batman character much convincing well better keep awake action said film sadly one generous yet disappointing,positive,13
"I went in with ultra-low expectations because I think Robert Pattison is a god-awful actor and, this film took my expectations and made me promptly realise that, you can always go lower.I'm actually angry I wasted 3 hours of my life (and trust me, every minute of that time was felt).However, let's have some positives: cinematography is great and the music is fantastic. The opening scenes with The Batman made me think, I was going to have another Heath moment and be forced to eat my words because those opening scenes are indeed something special.But then the film gets going. Part ""Saw"" rip-off and so desperately wants to be ""Se7en"" in its execution, the story dragged. You don't care about any of the characters and I found myself pining for Clooney and his bat-nipples and Mr. Freeze.What I found really funny though is the producer of this utter mess got in touch with Nolan and warned him, ""We're going to make a better Batman than you."" No. Just no.Like the last Lord of The Rings film, this has an ending that just keeps on coming. Something wraps up and you start to get ready to leave, the film continues. Something else is wrapped up and you think, ""That's it..."" and it keeps going.... Something else, and on and on and on...I can see why the guy in the seat nearby racked up a massive line of coke and snorted it midway through (and no, I'm not joking... Welcome to Southampton).With regards to the plank of wood.... Sorry... ""Pattison"". In the initial scenes I was genuinely excited. Never a fan of his costume before, seeing it here - suddenly I ""got it"". He proper beats down on someone in a vicious attack. They get back up... In fact, everyone he bat-punches gets back up and just attacks him from behind again. There's no real threat here. When Bale smacked someone down, they stayed dead. But then, when Bale stripped off (same as Affleck), they were built. Robert looked like me and I look like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons. A skeletal mess with no beef there whatsoever. In fact, when Robert bent over in one topless scene, his bones stuck out and I thought wings were going to pop out. But then, why wouldn't they when he infamously said he refused to bulk up for the role (I would have sacked him there and then).His time as Bruce is strictly limited - thank God - so you can't really judge him for that. As Bruce he just stands there and looks confused. As The Batman, by the end he became a parody. His Batman voice changed to the same sound as the joke Batman in the college humour videos (A is for Alfred = genius). When he was mad, it just look like he was pulling a cum-face. And don't even get me started on the Adrian Mole diary keeping that's going in with the voice-over narration.Honestly, with the exception of the opening ten minutes or so, I have never hated a film so much as I did this and given I went in with low expectations, even I am surprised at how fuming I am at myself for wasting my time on it.",went ultra low expectation think robert pattison god awful actor film took expectation made promptly realise always go lower actually angry wasted hour life trust every minute time felt however let positive cinematography great music fantastic opening scene batman made think going another heath moment forced eat word opening scene indeed something special film get going part saw rip desperately want se en execution story dragged care character found pining clooney bat nipple mr freeze found really funny though producer utter mess got touch nolan warned going make better batman like last lord ring film ending keep coming something wrap start get ready leave film continues something else wrapped think keep going something else see guy seat nearby racked massive line coke snorted midway joking welcome southampton regard plank wood sorry pattison initial scene genuinely excited never fan costume seeing suddenly got proper beat someone vicious attack get back fact everyone bat punch get back attack behind real threat bale smacked someone stayed dead bale stripped affleck built robert looked like look like mr burn simpson skeletal mess beef whatsoever fact robert bent one topless scene bone stuck thought wing going pop infamously said refused bulk role would sacked time bruce strictly limited thank god really judge bruce stand look confused batman end became parody batman voice changed sound joke batman college humour video alfred genius mad look like pulling cum face even get started adrian mole diary keeping going voice narration honestly exception opening ten minute never hated film much given went low expectation even surprised fuming wasting time,negative,14
"Matt Reeves is not a good director at all-- -he's made one decent film, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and everything else he's done falls into one of two categories: junk and overrated junk. (Thank goodness The Batman is at least the latter instead of the former). If the director wasn't trying sooooo hard to make the film 'dark' maybe he could have created a new category of just overrated.Firstly, David Fincher himself is bad enough, but David Fincher imitations are even worse. This movie's rote serial-killer plot indulges in every single one of the irritating tropes that Nolan already played around with, most notably the 'but he wanted to be captured!' eye-roller. (Also irritating are Reeves' cheap attempts to desecrate Schubert's music while indulging the trope of the classical music-loving psychopath). Modern culture's obsession with and inadvertent glorification of serial killers is one of my greatest pet peeves---they are just pathetic and boring characters who are all the same. Exchange the Riddler for any of the killers in Fincher's movies and there is basically no difference. And it irritated me to no end how practically every character allowed themselves to fall prey to the Riddler's petty mind games- - if I was there I would promptly tell him to p*ss off and take his stupid video calls elsewhere, even if there was a bomb strapped to my neck.Secondly, the casting is sometimes bizarre. DC has often thrived on unorthodox casting-if they can make Ben Affleck work as Batman anything goes-but they trip up here since we have the high-water mark of the Nolan trilogy to compare it to. Andy Serkis as Alfred? That completely does not work; he just lacks the sophistication of Michael Caine. The new Commissioner Gordon is no Gary Oldman, that's for sure. The Riddler joins the swelling ranks of villains desperately trying to imitate Heath Ledger. (The Riddler from the '66 Batman show was vastly superior--heck, Jim Carrey was). The new Catwoman is alright given the rest of this casting, but is rendered irritating by a script that causes here to carry ON and ON about some friend of hers that ends up killed. Why she's so emotionally attached to this friend is a mystery not even Batman dares solve. The closest thing to a saving grace is the infamously unrecognizable Colin Farrell as the Penguin--- the car chase scene was great even as I kept wondering why none of the vehicles were hydroplaning with something like a full inch of water on the road.Thirdly, the pacing is off. I've seen people accuse Nolan of being portentous, but The Batman takes it to a whole new level with it's bloated runtime. It doesn't even have the quasi-grandeur of the Snyder Cut due to the banal serial killer story which mostly requires people to pop in and out of the Penguin's club ad nauseam. Reeves said that he was supposedly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock, but other than a 'Rear Window' throwback in the opening scene I don't see it. The film is mostly shot like a generic TV procedural filtered through a David Fincher lens, and Reeves completely lacks the morbid playfulness that made Hitchcock so sublime. (Compare any Riddler murder to the one in 'Dial M for Murder', which is one of the more mediocre Hitchcocks). Reeve's sole technique for suspense is to have the Riddler hovering around in the background while an unsuspecting victim putters about.Ugh.

"A serial killer strikes in Gotham City, killing important political figures, and leaving behind a series of cryptic clues, only Batman can stop him.It's certainly very different to all previous Batman films, it's definitely dark and atmospheric, but the pitch and narrative are very different. The Batman is told almost as a crime noir, made in a way that you could watch it in black and white to enjoy a different perspective.Interesting in that it's a real exploration of the character, his past and family, we get a sense as to why this Batman is so haunted.I wasn't blown away when I heard that Robert Pattinson was cast as Batman, Vengeance, but I was won over very quickly by him, clearly penned as a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, this incarnation is dark, haunted, relentless, but strong and determined. Don't expect laughs or lighter moments, there aren't any.Andy Serkis awesome as always, I thought Colin Farrell and Paul Dano were great too.Great visuals throughout, Gotham looks terrific, and there are some terrific special effects, and a few duff ones too. I think Pattinson looked awesome in the costume, it was well designed.The music was fantastic I thought, one of the movie's best elements, interesting seeing so much carnage played out to Ave Maria, a real juxtaposition.I wish I could say it was without any flaws, as it is an epic, imaginative reimagining, one that deserved its success, however pacing is an issue, it feels long for the sake of being long at times, some scenes are painfully drawn out. Some of the dialogue was hard to make our at times too, was it me, or was some of it a little muffled?What I really didn't like though, the ending, that has to knock a couple of stars of the rating, it just didn't work.Interesting to see what comes next, this was an imaginative retelling.7/10.",serial killer strike gotham city killing important political figure leaving behind series cryptic clue batman stop certainly different previous batman film definitely dark atmospheric pitch narrative different batman told almost crime noir made way could watch black white enjoy different perspective interesting real exploration character past family get sense batman haunted blown away heard robert pattinson cast batman vengeance quickly clearly penned character weight world shoulder incarnation dark haunted relentless strong determined expect laugh lighter moment andy serkis awesome always thought colin farrell paul dano great great visuals throughout gotham look terrific terrific special effect duff one think pattinson looked awesome costume well designed music fantastic thought one movie best element interesting seeing much carnage played ave maria real juxtaposition wish could say without flaw epic imaginative reimagining one deserved success however pacing issue feel long sake long time scene painfully drawn dialogue hard make time little muffled really like though ending knock couple star rating work interesting see come next imaginative retelling,positive,16
"The Batman (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught an advanced screening of last night. The storyline follows Gotham shortly after ""The Batman"" has emerged and established himself in the streets. A serial killer known as The Riddler starts a killing spree of everyone influential within Gotham's hierarchy until Bruce Wayne in inevitably the target. How are all of these people tied together and can Batman tie the pieces together before Wayne is the next victim?This movie is directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) and stars Robert Pattinson (Twilight), Zoë Kravitz (Kimi), Colin Farrell (Total Recall), Paul Dano (There Will be Blood), John Turturro (Do the Right Thing), Peter Sarsgaard (Garden State), Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings), Jeffrey Wright (Shaft) and Barry Keoghan (Eternals).The storyline, look and feel of this movie is an A+. The characters are perfectly cast and well executed. Farrell, Dano and Kravitz were a 10/10.This movie does a fantastic job of depicting the Batman universe with the appropriate grit and feel and the lighting and cinematography is excellent. This also did a good job of creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within the storyline and at the end. This has a very good Jeph Loeb comics feel to it and does a good job delivering the ""Detective"" elements of Batman. The violence was also brilliant and very well done. I will say this did not need to be 3-hours and there are an abundance of scenes that could have been better edited. This film likely should have been a hair under 2 and a half hours.Overall this is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for Batman fans. I would score this a 7.5- 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",batman movie wife caught advanced screening last night storyline follows gotham shortly batman emerged established street serial killer known riddler start killing spree everyone influential within gotham hierarchy bruce wayne inevitably target people tied together batman tie piece together wayne next victim movie directed matt reef cloverfield star robert pattinson twilight zo kravitz kimi colin farrell total recall paul dano blood john turturro right thing peter sarsgaard garden state andy serkis lord ring jeffrey wright shaft barry keoghan eternals storyline look feel movie character perfectly cast well executed farrell dano kravitz movie fantastic job depicting batman universe appropriate grit feel lighting cinematography excellent also good job creating various potential spinoffs subtle reference within storyline end good jeph loeb comic feel good job delivering detective element batman violence also brilliant well done say need hour abundance scene could better edited film likely hair half hour overall magnificent addition super hero genre absolute must see batman fan would score strongly recommend,positive,17
"THE BATMAN (2022) *** Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, Paul Dano, John Turturro, Andy Serkis, Peter Sarsgaard. Filmmaker Matt Reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the Bob Kane comic book hero with Pattinson standing tall and brooding as Bruce Wayne employing vigilante style justice as The Caped Cursader while Gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal Riddler (Dano affectively disturbing) and gaining an unlikely ally in Selina Kyle (ass-kicking Kravitz in pre-Catwoman mode). Arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by Greig Fraser and James Chinlund's production design all aided by the foreboding score by Michael Giacchino full of bombast and dread.

"To preface this review I will say when watching this in the cinemas, many people walked out. I was looking over my shoulder to see of anyone else was laughing at what cringe this movie delivers.The actors in this were one of the highlights excluding the villain (the riddler) and the Batman. Penguin was by far the coolest and best actor. Honestly a good fellas type character. All other supporting actors were also quite good. I however think Robert pattinson a horrible pick for Batman. The whole time he seems like a really awkward and sad goth kid, I was half expecting him to say ""gosh get outta my room"". Absolutely trash acting The riddler was even worse! He was the major cringe factor in this movie with awful and dorky video calls where he is super non intimidating and laughable. His video calls reminded me of the horror films my 15 year old class mates had made in high school, their budgets were $0.The relationship between the Batman and cat woman was my only other plus in this movie. The romance was quite sweet and had a lot of tension. They rode around In their awesome motorcycles just roaring through the town it was really cute.The bat mobile was pretty awesome but definitely very weird for a Batman film. The old classic camaro was a little spine chilling not gonna lie.Now to answer everyone's questions I do think Robert pattinson was a terrible choice for Batman for a few reasons. At first I had no qualms but watching the film made me believe he was a bad and cringey actor for the role, he just isn't a badass over masculine kinda guy, like at all. He seems awkward and it shows. His voice wasn't that great, his body was not very big nor muscular like many other batmans, heck even the joker is ripped in suicide squad. The guy is 6ft exactly but his frame is tiny and it shows next to bigger actors. The story was God awful without spoiling pretty much lots of people die, bombs go off and some personal people Batman knows get injured. Then Batman goes welp I can't be in 3 places at once I'm only human. And proceeds to get ko'd twice throughout the movie and punched lots during fights. He is by far the worst and weakest looking Batman with the worst actor to have played him. The cinematography was good and the horror feeling this brings is good but everything else was just so horrible. Did I mention this film is 3 hours long to have a crap middle and end? Well know I know!. Wow I couldn't wait for thr 3 hours to end and multiple people walked out before the film was half finished. Definitely wouldn't reccomend this garbage piece of cinema. 2/10 for me.",preface review say watching cinema many people walked looking shoulder see anyone else laughing cringe movie delivers actor one highlight excluding villain riddler batman penguin far coolest best actor honestly good fella type character supporting actor also quite good however think robert pattinson horrible pick batman whole time seems like really awkward sad goth kid half expecting say gosh get outta room absolutely trash acting riddler even worse major cringe factor movie awful dorky video call super non intimidating laughable video call reminded horror film year old class mate made high school budget relationship batman cat woman plus movie romance quite sweet lot tension rode around awesome motorcycle roaring town really cute bat mobile pretty awesome definitely weird batman film old classic camaro little spine chilling gonna lie answer everyone question think robert pattinson terrible choice batman reason first qualm watching film made believe bad cringey actor role badass masculine kinda guy like seems awkward show voice great body big muscular like many batman heck even joker ripped suicide squad guy ft exactly frame tiny show next bigger actor story god awful without spoiling pretty much lot people die bomb go personal people batman know get injured batman go welp place human proceeds get ko twice throughout movie punched lot fight far worst weakest looking batman worst actor played cinematography good horror feeling brings good everything else horrible mention film hour long crap middle end well know know wow wait thr hour end multiple people walked film half finished definitely reccomend garbage piece cinema,negative,20
"For better or worse (mostly better), The Batman is when he's detective first, superhero second. A bleak yet thrilling noir but also with a glimpse of exhilarating hope.

I never thought that I would view a worse DC movie than Catwoman or the Harley Quinn movie. I was sorely mistaken. The Batman by far is the absolute biggest mistake in any comic book adaptation. The casting was wrong - there was not one cast member who had a good performance; the script was pitiful - it was too long and all over the place; the direction was terrible and the editing was questionable.Nothing was a positive about this film except the end credits where you could escape the misery.,never thought would view worse dc movie catwoman harley quinn movie sorely mistaken batman far absolute biggest mistake comic book adaptation casting wrong one cast member good performance script pitiful long place direction terrible editing questionable nothing positive film except end credit could escape misery,negative,22
"I'll say it started pretty good and I liked the cinematography. But I thought it dragged on, and the social commentary on destroying ""white privileged men"" was ironic as that's what Batman is- a privileged white rich guy who can mascarade as a vigilante because he's rich and has all the free time to do so; and we feel for him because boo boo he's an orphan. This was a very obvious ""woke"" fest. I like the diversity but it's when they blatantly shove rhetoric down your throat that it starts to become cringey. Pattinson was so sleepy, like Joe Biden in a Batman suit sleepy. Joker is my favorite movie of all time and I feel like they tried to go for that but it just had too many missteps. I did like Farrell as the Penguin and the Riddler was basically Dexter the Anti-hero...",say started pretty good liked cinematography thought dragged social commentary destroying white privileged men ironic batman privileged white rich guy mascarade vigilante rich free time feel boo boo orphan obvious woke fest like diversity blatantly shove rhetoric throat start become cringey pattinson sleepy like joe biden batman suit sleepy joker favorite movie time feel like tried go many misstep like farrell penguin riddler basically dexter anti hero,positive,23
"""It's a big city. I can't be everywhere."" Batman (Rob Pattison)
A more complete adaptation of the Batman comics presence there isn't, and no more gothic, spot-on condemnation of human frailty since the 50-year-old Godfather. Writer/director Matt Reeves' The Batman is arguably the definitive dark night of the American soul in its corruption and its salvation. As an achievement of robust American neo noir, it ranks somewhere behind Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and Godfather.Batman (Rob Pattinson) scowls as if he came from a Twilight frame of mind while he shows a soft side in his love for Selena Kyle/Cat Woman (Zoe Kravitz), the Bat and the Cat, working to save the city from the likes of Riddler (Paul Dano), Penguin (Colin Farrell), and crime lord Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Besides offing a large number of corrupt city employees, they offer Bruce Wayne a chance to learn about his obsession with his parents' public and private lives and their untimely deaths. Although none of the bad boys eclipses the impact of Heath Ledger's multidimensional Joker, even in his humor, together they are a powerful cast of darkness.Besides bringing together an ensemble of estimable actors in every role, Reeves gathers expert cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer James Chinlund to create a darkness full of telling images while competing with the great film noir compositions of all time. Dark, yes, obscure, no. The darkness that envelopes each scene says more about the bleak side of humanity than any written treatise could.Besides the corruption of city officials, The Batman casts a shadow over the virtue of vengeance, embodied in Wayne's longing to account for the death of his parents and bad-boys like Riddler to assuage the pain of his childhood by terrorizing the city. In his favor, Riddler is ridding the city of corrupt power while Batman is cleaning it of its petty criminals. His stalwart ally, Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), realizes that the real crimes are housed in his police force and ultimately his supervisors.The Batman is a hip and incisive representation of modern angst that not even a hero can relieve, at least not right now:To the strains of Nirvana's baleful Something In The Way: ""They think I'm hiding in the shadows, but I AM the shadows.""

"What were Reeves and Craig thinking? I mean, wasn't the Douglas Nolan Bat-trilogy with Christian Bale dark and pessimistic enough? Did they have to try and top that by painting Bruce Wayne's parents as not being so spotless? And what was with the nearly three-hour running time?Between those two factors, this movie felt more like the love child of ""Gone With The Wind"" and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker flick. Which is most definitely _not_ a good thing!

"You've seen a million Batman movies, but you still need to steel yourself for the darkest Dark Knight yet. Starring Robert Pattinson as DC's Caped Crusader, 2022's new movie The Batman is an intense, apocalyptic cinematic experience. Following the famous murder of Bruce Waynes parents, Wayne is two years into his crusade against Gotham City street crime. As Batman unpicks the cryptic clues, the investigation peels away a greater conspiracy. But the real riddle is how the ranting killer's twisted motive ties back to Batman himself. He Batman (in theaters March 4) is barely a superhero movie, Christopher Nolan's criminal politics and Zack Snyder's operatic brutality, plus the standalone Joker movie's psychological backstory, vaguely timeless design and layers of dark irony. Most of all, The Batman is a straight up horror film. This new flick is PG-13, but it's on a whole other level from the relatively bloodless Dark Knight movies -- and on a different planet from any Marvel film -- immersing you in a nerve-shredding three hours of escalating dread and simmering pain garnished with some astonishingly nasty, and dark touches, and makes think what one man can go through because of loosing his parents. You absolutely 100% can't show The Batman to a child, it will give them nightmares, and bad thoughts. Robert Pattinson's batman is lank-haired mess, and is a world away from Christian Bales outstanding professional look. This darkest Dark Knight may not be for everyone (and certainly not kids), but it's a gripping and nerve-shredding Bat-thriller. The one thing that Matt Reeves explores that Christopher Nolan doesn't is how dark and how can he make it to the story, and comic, and even a horror movie. The Batman should have been rated R not PG-13 because how intense, Dark and scary it is. The soundtrack was done by Michael Giacchino, its very graceful incorporation of specific themes for Batman and Selina, as well as pre-existing music ranging from classical pieces to Nirvana, provides tonal variation to ensure that The Batman never becomes a punishing downer.

"What's the one thought you had when Warner Bros. Casted Robert Pattinson as the Batman? Mine was 'Nooooooo!!!'. I was bewildered on the decision, questioning if this the best they've got for Batman? I didn't hate him but I was concerned if he could take up a big role like this as he doesn't have the regular features embodied by the titular character.And today's the day I witness myself that I was wrong, Pattinson is a great Batman. Hell, he slayed as Batman! Yes, his features don't really resemble the classic Batman, but he made it his own! This is one Batman that is better than Ben Affleck and George Clooney and audience would compare him to the likes of Christian Bale and Michael Keaton. Also, there's something about Pattinson's jawline that complements his looks everytime he's wearing the mask. He oozes his seemingly mysterious vibe that appears alluring enough for audience.2022's The Batman runs for about 3 hours long and what's special about this one is it offers a journey that doesn't dive into its origin story, making it a different piece compared to others. It's not centred on 'my parents were killed in the back of an alley when I was a kid', but it takes on a different story, focusing more on Gotham city and its grim corruption happening within.It's engaging throughout though it's not meant for some viewers because... the narrative isn't made for audience preferring commercial films. I would say the context and story are as rich as The Dark Knight and Joker. If you have a big issue with these two, I mean this as no offense but stick to Marvel.Like one of those PS4 Batman games, the film offers a bleak and dreary look at Gotham, transporting the audience into a world of transparency and reality. It doesn't shy away from showing us the rawness of the city; the coal-coloured alleys and underground tunnels, the debris scattered on the floor and the hard-hitting fact that no one is safe therefore, audience has an easy time relating themselves with our world filled with arising problems and issues.If you're wondering Zoe Kravitz did a good job as Catwoman, I would say yes. However, she's my least favourite compared to others who have held the same role like Michelle Pfeiffer & Anne Hathaway. She could've been better.Kudos to the makeup department for putting on such a brilliant work for Mr Penguin. If I hadn't known that was Colin Farrell, I would not have recognized him even a bit. Farrell did an excellent job as Penguin but there were a few times that he reminded me of Jared Leto's in House of Gucci with the overused accent🤣. And his character was mostly missing in the second half which was a let-down for me.What a brave decision when they did a 180° turn on The Riddler. They realized that Gotham is a dark place, they changed Riddler into someone darker than what the comic has offered. The Riddler is profoundly menacing and he will remind you of Heath's Joker in TDK once in a while. Paul Dano did a great job but... I felt they could have picked another actor. Prolly that's just me but hey, Dano is 👏👍.One of the issues I have is the overused soundtrack. For all 3 hours long, rarely you will encounter a scene with no music background 🤣. It takes away a bit of the grounded experience and the suspense that comes from it. If only they restrained the music much more, I believe this film would be scarier. What's worse is the music that was playing sounded quite the same with the next, it comes to a point where I felt irritated by it.Also, I wasn't impressed by the climax scene. It feels like they are not giving their best shot. It's just not 'ummphhh' enough as what has been hinted in the first two hours. Just when you thought it's the beginning of an exciting final battle scene is apparently almost the end of the movie.The reason behind this might probably be because of the not-so-formidable villain. Let's take a recent example, The Riddler is somewhat similar to Rami Malek's Safin in No Time to Die in terms of his capabilities and abilities; they both ace in strategy and planning but weak in combating, resulting in an almost non-existent final battle.Verdict: As if like a bleak painting canvas sold at a prestigious auction, The Batman exhibits an ambitious look into Gotham's gritty landscape all along strongly coloured with a frighteningly dour tone, illuminating what could possibly be the best movie of the year so far.",one thought warner bros casted robert pattinson batman mine nooooooo bewildered decision questioning best got batman hate concerned could take big role like regular feature embodied titular character today day witness wrong pattinson great batman hell slayed batman yes feature really resemble classic batman made one batman better ben affleck george clooney audience would compare like christian bale michael keaton also something pattinson jawline complement look everytime wearing mask ooze seemingly mysterious vibe appears alluring enough audience batman run hour long special one offer journey dive origin story making different piece compared others centred parent killed back alley kid take different story focusing gotham city grim corruption happening within engaging throughout though meant viewer narrative made audience preferring commercial film would say context story rich dark knight joker big issue two mean offense stick marvel like one p batman game film offer bleak dreary look gotham transporting audience world transparency reality shy away showing u rawness city coal coloured alley underground tunnel debris scattered floor hard hitting fact one safe therefore audience easy time relating world filled arising problem issue wondering zoe kravitz good job catwoman would say yes however least favourite compared others held role like michelle pfeiffer anne hathaway could better kudos makeup department putting brilliant work mr penguin known colin farrell would recognized even bit farrell excellent job penguin time reminded jared leto house gucci overused accent character mostly missing second half let brave decision turn riddler realized gotham dark place changed riddler someone darker comic offered riddler profoundly menacing remind heath joker tdk paul dano great job felt could picked another actor prolly hey dano one issue overused soundtrack hour long rarely encounter scene music background take away bit grounded experience suspense come restrained music much believe film would scarier worse music playing sounded quite next come point felt irritated also impressed climax scene feel like giving best shot ummphhh enough hinted first two hour thought beginning exciting final battle scene apparently almost end movie reason behind might probably formidable villain let take recent example riddler somewhat similar ramus malek safin time die term capability ability ace strategy planning weak combating resulting almost non existent final battle verdict like bleak painting canvas sold prestigious auction batman exhibit ambitious look gotham gritty landscape along strongly coloured frighteningly dour tone illuminating could possibly best movie year far,positive,30
"This film delivers a much darker and more sinister Batman, quite unlike the many versions that have gone before. The representation of Gotham as well, is steeped in corruption and decay. The story opens with the death of the city's mayor, and from there introduces the principal characters that are part of the Batman legacy that are known all too well by fans. In tone, I think this film was more like the ""Gotham"" cable series than any of the prior movies, even if that show had more to do with the young Bruce Wayne growing into the masked crime fighter. The villains both in ""Gotham"" and in this story personified the evil and malice that gripped Batman's hometown, with an added element of corruption in the background of Bruce Wayne's father that put him under the thumb of crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro).All of the performances here were exceptional. Robert Pattinson's take on Batman was more effective than his portrayal of Bruce Wayne, who looked like he was part of the grunge scene. I didn't much care for the Batman outfit, it looked unusually heavy and clunky; one's first inkling that Batman was arriving was heralded by the thumping footsteps one might associate with ""Jurassic Park"". Pattinson's voice as Batman, as well as those of Lieutenant Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) and The Riddler (Paul Dano) sounded like they were coming through a synthesizer. It made for dramatic effect, although not quite realistic.This film version of The Riddler is not like anything you've seen before or would have expected. His off-screen portrayals hinted at a demented masked vigilante, which made the actual appearance of the character that much more compelling when it revealed an almost baby faced Dano in the role of a psychotic madman. Quite honestly, it wasn't until the credits rolled that I became aware that Colin Farrell had the role of Oz, hidden underneath all the prosthetics and make-up. Yes, he was referred to as The Penguin, but it wasn't overdone, and his full name (Oswald Cobblepot) was never mentioned.Rounding out the principals was Zoe Kravitz as the slinky Catwoman, Selina Kyle. She had some major kick butt action in the film, and rose to the occasion to save Batman's near the end of the story. Speaking of which, even with his seemingly armor plated outfit, Batman appeared unusually vulnerable to attacks by his foes in the picture. It marked him as more human than the average super-hero with unusual powers.I will say this, your attention needs to be focused due to the nuances that are revealed in the telling of Bruce Wayne's parents' story and how he might have been misled growing up. His father's relationship with Falcone and fellow mob boss Salvatore Moroni bear on Gotham's reputation. Maybe it was inadvertent, but there might have been a subliminal tribute to the ""Gotham"" series here with the character of Falcone associate Kenzie (Peter McDonald). The role of James Gordon in that series was portrayed by Ben McKenzie.",film delivers much darker sinister batman quite unlike many version gone representation gotham well steeped corruption decay story open death city mayor introduces principal character part batman legacy known well fan tone think film like gotham cable series prior movie even show young bruce wayne growing masked crime fighter villain gotham story personified evil malice gripped batman hometown added element corruption background bruce wayne father put thumb crime bos carmine falcone john turturro performance exceptional robert pattinson take batman effective portrayal bruce wayne looked like part grunge scene much care batman outfit looked unusually heavy clunky one first inkling batman arriving heralded thumping footstep one might associate jurassic park pattinson voice batman well lieutenant gordon jeffrey wright riddler paul dano sounded like coming synthesizer made dramatic effect although quite realistic film version riddler like anything seen would expected screen portrayal hinted demented masked vigilante made actual appearance character much compelling revealed almost baby faced dano role psychotic madman quite honestly credit rolled became aware colin farrell role oz hidden underneath prosthetics make yes referred penguin overdone full name oswald cobblepot never mentioned rounding principal zoe kravitz slinky catwoman selina kyle major kick butt action film rose occasion save batman near end story speaking even seemingly armor plated outfit batman appeared unusually vulnerable attack foe picture marked human average super hero unusual power say attention need focused due nuance revealed telling bruce wayne parent story might misled growing father relationship falcone fellow mob bos salvatore moroni bear gotham reputation maybe inadvertent might subliminal tribute gotham series character falcone associate kenzie peter mcdonald role james gordon series portrayed ben mckenzie,positive,31
"Right from the 1st leaked screenshots I had doubts about this movie, wasn't bothered by the fact Robbie Pattinson was playing the main man, moody, morose, silent, he had all the things necessary to portray the brooding Batman, unfortunately he had no screen presence, the Batman's mere look should strike fear, Pattinsons didn't, had the resounding thumps of his Jack boots not been amplified to sound like a herd of elephants it would've been easy for him to go unnoticed among the throngs of police officers & various characters.The only scene that attempted to inject any excitement was the ""budget Batmobile"" chase scene, overly long, quite pointless & shockingly silly and far far too loud, another problem with this movie, whereas the musical score was for the most part the best thing about this movie it's actual sound was one of the worst, every screech, scream and gunshot was turned up to maximum, deafening the audience.Of course the real villain of this movie is the story or more precisely its lack of one, yes we're introduced to ""the Penguin"" an overweight balding scar faced slob that screams more sleazy pervert than villain & a complete waste of use of the character then its ""the Riddler"" a bespectacled ""youtuber"" in what's best described as a gimp costume, a character with no special talents yet is somehow able to enter unseen an exclusive apartment and commit murder, a locked vehicle to over power it's driver and enter unseen a police gym and over power the cheif of police and kidnap him and all the while screeching like a banshee on video & facetime.The films runtime is far too long telling a story that is uninteresting and ultimately very boring, there are no heroic deeds performed no good guy to root for.The time line for this movie becomes apparent from the diary kept by Bruce Wayne and various TV news broadcasts, this is year two in the career of the Batman yet he isn't the vigilante that's feared by the criminal underground yet he's hated by the police force, with no context to work from of his past deeds as a vigilante its very confusing.Quite simply this isn't a movie about Batman , Pattinson could have played the character without the costume and the movie would have still been the same, a very boring lacklustre detective story.Zoe Kravitz plays Catwoman, a character completely different to the Halle Berry version but played equally as badly.Put simply this movie ranks worse Batman movie behind the awful Batman and Robin, as the caped crusader Pattinson isn't a patch on Keaton, Kilmer, Bale or even Afflek.I can only imagine Warner Bros/DC wanted to emulate the profits they raked in from ""The Joker"" so decided to give Batman the same treatment but where ""Joker"" stripped away everything and concentrated on the character ""The Batman"" strips away everything about the character and concentrates on everything else, the sets, cinematography and secondary characters are fine tuned and highly detailed whereas Batman is reduced to a pair of ""Jack boots"" clumping through the movie.By the end of Matt Reeves ""The Batman"" I felt I knew a little about what it was like to be in a hostage situation, the elation I felt at the ending of the movie gave newly found strength to my numbed legs allowing me to bound out from the cinema seat seeking the freedom of the evening air, it was a wonderful experience, something I sadly can't say about the movie.Nolans trilogy is still the best, he gave the character a begging a middle and an end and he did it with style all the while telling a complex and interesting story about complex and interesting characters, Matt Reeves fails abysmally with ""The Batman"" choosing to emulate scenes from past Batman movies rather than creating something new and unseen, from Keatons Bruce Wayne to Bales Dark Knight it's all there easily recognised.If this is Reeves idea of re-booting the character for a new generation then it was a pointless endeavour, the new generation hasn't the need or interest for it, they certainly don't have the patience to sit through 3 hours of it.The movie is about the beginning of Batman's career when he is young, full of the energy necessary to fight the criminals and crime of Gotham city, Pattinsons ""Batman"" meanders through the movie as if he were a zombie looking disinterested and deflated, this is not a superhero movie nor a movie about a hero, it should not be a movie at all.",right st leaked screenshots doubt movie bothered fact robbie pattinson playing main man moody morose silent thing

"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Batman"" (2022) for me personally was not as entertaining as Christopher Nolan's take in ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy. If i would compare this movie to Nolan's series, it would be more close to ""The Dark Knight"". That said i liked ""The Batman"" for its being very faithful adaptation of Batman universe itself. I saw two or three DC' animated Batman movies and this film was more in common with those then any other Batman movie ever made.""The Batman"" (2022) is a very dark movie, and i mean that in every way. In a whole 3 hours running time there is basically scene or two set in day time. And 98% of the film is set during night, and looks like in Gotham it is always raining. It is a very gritty and down to earth setting, and that i liked about it. The atmosphere of this movie highly reminded me of ""Se7en"" (1995). Performances were good and Robert Pattinson was a superb as Batman. Yet i think it was Zoë Kravitz who stole the show.Overall, ""The Batman"" (2022) is a dark, gritty and very down to earth adaptation of Batman. For younger audiences who grew up on watching Marvel movies (no offence - i really enjoy them as well) this adaptation of Batman will be a test of patience - this movie is not for everyone and reminded me of ""Joker"" (2019) more then any other comic book movie. In its running time 3 hours this movie did drag here and there, but as a whole package it really worth seeing. Not my favorite Batman movie, but a solid one.",greeting lithuania batman personally entertaining christopher nolan take dark knight trilogy would compare movie nolan series would close dark knight said liked batman faithful adaptation batman universe saw two three dc animated batman movie film common batman movie ever made batman dark movie mean every way whole hour running time basically scene two set day time film set night look like gotham always raining gritty earth setting liked atmosphere movie highly reminded se en performance good robert pattinson superb batman yet think zo kravitz stole show overall batman dark gritty earth adaptation batman younger audience grew watching marvel movie offence really enjoy well adaptation batman test patience movie everyone reminded joker comic book movie running time hour movie drag whole package really worth seeing favorite batman movie solid one,positive,33

Matt Reeves never disappoints with choice of color, tone and over all cinematography.That being said, the story wasnt that interesting to be honest. Nothing was surprising or intriguing and because of that, the result was a poor nonthreatening antagonistAs for character casting, Zoe Kravitz is probably the worst Catwoman. Not one Catwoman characteristic was displayed. Might as well get anyone to play Catwoman. Jeffrey Wright was surprisingly a good Jim Gordan although i have no idea when Batman had a partner lol. John Turturro just looks too goofy to pull off as some crazy mob boss/supporting antagonist. Colin Farrell was amazing 👊The greatest detective/tactician failed to do any real detective work.

"I assume there are still people out there that cannot stand Robert Pattinson. This dislike was born when he accepted one of the main roles in the Twilight universe. If you are one of those, I do not think I will be able to sway you - to convince you otherwise. I could tell you, that he has proven himself as an actor in many films since then. And when I say that I am not trying to put the Twilight Saga down. I was not the target audience of that - still I saw some interesting things in there, but also things that I did not like at all.But this is about ... The Batman! A distinction in the title - maybe to be able to find it better when browsing or looking for it. Because and I'm sure you are aware of that: there are many other movies called Batman. Actually before Marvel took over the reigns, DC was the one producing good comic book movies. Superman and Batman being the most noteable ones. No one back then thought of combining the heroes though. Everyone stayed in their lane. Something this movie does too. And maybe it is better if DC does not emulate or copy the MCU formula ... I understand that it is more than tempting considering all the money that is involved of course.All that history aside, this as I already said, is a standalone movie. This is about The Batman! And while you may have your favorite (Keaton, West or Bale - though maybe even Affleck or the unlikely choice of Kilmer or Clooney), do not condemn the Patts just yet. He really transforms and gets into the role ... a role that anyone should consider an honor to play.I am overall a MCU fan boy as some may call me. But I have a deep love for the Bats. And while that makes me at least somewhat biased, this is not the reason I am surprised the movie has such a high rating. I am surprised because the movie is long (even if you don't really feel it - even when you may think at times ""alright we have spent quite a lot of time lingering haven't we?"") and because it is quite dark ... pun intended. The tone and the overall lighting of the movie.There is violence here - things that a decade or so ago, you may not have been able to get away with and still get a PG13 rating. Bashing of the head with a blunt object? Yes you don't get close ups and there is not as much blood to be seen as with other movies that also have head bashings - but just the thought and certain glimpses we get to see ... is more than enough.But all that and the fact this is a detective story ... really help elevate the movie. That and a strong cast of people. I thought Jared Leto had one of the greatest transformations for House of Gucci ... but Colin Farrell actually isn't recognizable in this. And would also fit in the House of Gucci, considering the italian accent/New York slang he uses.The darkness and the shadows play a big role. And you may find yourself looking to find something in them ... even something (or someone?) that doesn't exist/is there. The action scenes are really well played out - there is even one that reminisces that feeling you may have had playing a game or two with the Batman. Arkham City may arguably be the best game of the series - with a fighting system that really is extraordinary. Many have tried to copy it - but I never felt that seemless flow in anything else I've played since then.And then there is the sound system ... I watched it in Imax too, though it doesn't seem to have been filmed with an Imax camera. Still bigger screen so all good. But the sound ... wow! Just wow - incredible.So while I still feel that The Dark Knight is a bit better - this comes as close as they get. Coincidences and convenient timing aside. Because a lot of things have to go right (or wrong depending on your perspective) for the movie and the story to work ... still small and minor ""flaws"" like that aside - because that should not stop you from enjoying this very well made movie.Edit: Since this is not an origin story, but still the beginnings of Batman, he is not invincible and he may not have every gimmick/toy/car/vehicle you may expect him to have. There is one truly great car chase though ... I personally would not compare it to the real great ones you may have seen (Bullit, French Connection and so forth) and just see it as a thing that works on its own. Also the added bonus - after credits ""scene"" - is really not something that many will think worthwhile ... as in worth staying and watching the credits through to get this ... well let's call it easter egg, that is not really a scene, but a callback to a scene from earlier ... with a promise for the future one may say. Still you can google it and it probably will have the same effect as if you watched it ""unfold"".",assume still people cannot stand robert pattinson dislike born accepted one main role twilight universe one think able sway convince otherwise could tell proven actor many film since say trying put twilight saga target audience still saw interesting thing also thing like batman distinction title maybe able find better browsing looking sure aware many movie called batman actually marvel took reign dc one producing good comic book movie superman batman noteable one one back thought combining hero though everyone stayed lane something movie maybe better dc emulate copy mcu formula understand tempting considering money involved course history aside already said standalone movie batman may favorite keaton west bale though maybe even affleck unlikely choice kilmer clooney condemn patts yet really transforms get role role anyone consider honor play overall mcu fan boy may call deep love bat make least somewhat biased reason surprised movie high rating surprised movie long even really feel even may think time alright spent quite lot time lingering quite dark pun intended tone overall lighting movie violence thing decade ago may able get away still get pg rating bashing head blunt object yes get close ups much blood seen movie also head bashings thought certain glimpse get see enough fact detective story really help elevate movie strong cast people thought jared leto one greatest transformation house gucci colin farrell actually recognizable would also fit house gucci considering italian accent new york slang us darkness shadow play big role may find looking find something even something someone exist action scene really well played even one reminisces feeling may playing game two batman arkham city may arguably best game series fighting system really extraordinary many tried copy never felt seemless flow anything else played since sound system watched imax though seem filmed imax camera still bigger screen good sound wow wow incredible still feel dark knight bit better come close get coincidence convenient timing aside lot thing go right wrong depending perspective movie story work still small minor flaw like aside stop enjoying well made movie edit since origin story still beginning batman invincible may every gimmick toy car vehicle may expect one truly great car chase though personally would compare real great one may seen bullit french connection forth see thing work also added bonus credit scene really something many think worthwhile worth staying watching credit get well let call easter egg really scene callback scene earlier promise future one may say still google probably effect watched unfold,positive,36
"We are now on ""The Batman."" I suppose such a title is to distinguish it from plain ol' ""Batman."" Like the football players who are from ""The"" Ohio State University or ""The"" University of Miami as though there are impostors of those same schools out there that they have to distinguish themselves from.Robert Pattinson plays Batman, and while his Batman is adequate, his Bruce Wayne was underwhelming. His Batman seemed to have fewer gadgets, but he did at least make his suit bulletproof. His Bruce Wayne was barely shown, and when he was it was as if he carried the pain and anger of Batman with him. All other Bruce Wayne's were able to turn on the charm when in public, this Bruce Wayne has the ""life sucks"" face.""The Batman"" opted to be more of a murder mystery than an action flick. There was action (even a scene involving the Penguin in which the audience applauded), but nothing like Batmans past.A glasses-wearing masked man was committing a string of murders. He was killing high profile members of Gotham and leaving cyphers for Batman to figure out. The movie doesn't hide that the killer is the Riddler, while it does hide his true identity. The Riddler was circuitously directing Batman and others to a particular criminal he wanted outed. Batman and Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) suspected that the Riddler's final target was either The Penguin (Colin Farrell) or Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Whether or not it's either of them is saved for close to the end.Speaking of the end, this movie was nearly three hours long, and I began to feel it. There was a point that the movie could've wrapped up, and I thought it was, then it dragged on for another half-hour or so. I was happy to be in the theater watching a movie, but not that happy. A two hour movie would've been just as satisfying. After watching all of the previews it made the movie-going experience well over three hours.How does this Batman stack up against the others? OK.

"I've seen campy Batman movies from Joel Schumacher, I've seen more grounded/realistic Batman movies from Christopher Nolan, and I've even seen a goofy Batman movie from Chris McKay, but there's one thing I never in my life thought I'd see...a boring Batman movie. Matt Reeves pulled off that unlikely feat with this 3-hour-long drudgery of a film. Admittedly, I'm coming at this as a person who has never clicked with the character of the dark knight. I find Batman to be massively overrated, and I struggle to see why the entire world bows down to him as if he's the greatest superhero of all time. That being said, I can still find entertainment from his stories, and rarely have outright hatred for the films (aside from when Zack Snyder directs them.)The Batman feels like a film made after Matt Reeves spent a great deal of time reading fan discussions on the internet, so it ticks a number of the boxes that I've heard comic book nerds complain about over the years. They make a point of never having Batman kill anyone. I mean, one could argue a few received head wounds that could easily lead to their death, and he caused a car crash that could easily have been fatal, but at least he's not pulling out a gun on anyone or dropping people off the top of a building. Also, all those fanboys love to talk about Batman being the world's greatest detective, so in this movie the first time we see the Caped Crusader, he's literally walking into an active crime scene. It's a ridiculous juxtaposition that made me chuckle, but I'm sure there were some people out there who wanted to applaud that moment.The other aspect of The Batman that had me chuckling when I don't think they intended anything to actually be funny was when we meet Bruce Wayne outside of the mask. First of all, there's another bit of fan service in the fact that we actually see him with black makeup smeared around his eyes. But worse than that is just the exaggerated emo goth-kid look that makes it appear that Robert Pattinson is cosplaying as Gerard Way from My Chemical Romance. There were more than a few scenes where we are looking at Bruce Wayne through a bunch of long greasy black bangs and I was wondering who thought that was a good idea. I will give Pattinson credit for not overdoing the Batman voice too much, and almost always disguising his native British accent.As I said at the start, though, the big problem with The Batman is just the fact that it's boring. The film drags on and even the action sequences feel kind of bland and lacking in memorable moments. There's one car chase that stands out as the biggest moment where I was literally checking the time, because it added nothing to the plot of the film. The entire plot is a non-stop series of tropes that feel like I'm watching someone who wants to do a Tarantino-style homage to other crime-thrillers, but without the talent of Tarantino. The story is slow-moving, and insanely repetitive. I could not believe how many times they returned to the same places and did the same things. There was a complete lack of efficiency in the storytelling, as if no one was willing to cut anything, and I felt there were entire characters and storylines that could have easily gone without hurting the story one bit.The entire movie is built around a big puzzle, which I can get behind. It started developing as though there was a genuine murder mystery for us to uncover. But as things started to move along it became clear they didn't have a reveal that would warrant all the time they spent building it up. As a side note, I think I'll be happy if I never again have to see a scene where a person is questioned about who is the big bad behind everything, and they say they can't tell because something worse than death will happen to them. This only works as a stupid stalling technique to build suspense for the audience, and if you don't have a satisfactory surprise pay-off at the end it's totally ridiculous. Needless to say, The Batman did not have said pay-off. Its biggest surprise was that it wouldn't end because they constantly had one more scene. In every way I found The Batman to be a lackluster movie that somehow made me nostalgic for the days of Schumacher.",seen campy batman movie joel schumacher seen grounded realistic batman movie christopher nolan even seen goofy batman movie chris mckay one thing never life thought see boring batman movie matt reef pulled unlikely feat hour long drudgery film admittedly coming person never clicked character dark knight find batman massively overrated struggle see entire world bow greatest superhero time said still find entertainment story rarely outright hatred film aside zack snyder directs batman feel like film made matt reef spent great deal time reading fan discussion internet tick number box heard comic book nerd complain year make point never batman kill anyone mean one could argue received head wound could easily lead death caused car crash could easily fatal least pulling gun anyone dropping people top building also fanboys love talk batman world greatest detective movie first time see caped crusader literally walking active crime scene ridiculous juxtaposition made chuckle sure people wanted applaud moment aspect batman chuckling think intended anything actually funny meet bruce wayne outside mask first another bit fan service fact actually see black makeup smeared around eye worse exaggerated emo goth kid look make appear robert pattinson cosplaying gerard way chemical romance scene looking bruce wayne bunch long greasy black bang wondering thought good idea give pattinson credit overdoing batman voice much almost always disguising native british accent said start though big problem batman fact boring film drag even action sequence feel kind bland lacking memorable moment one car chase stand biggest moment literally checking time added nothing plot film entire plot non stop series trope feel like watching someone want tarantino style homage crime thriller without talent tarantino story slow moving insanely repetitive could believe many time returned place thing complete lack efficiency storytelling one willing cut anything felt entire character storyline could easily gone without hurting story one bit entire movie built around big puzzle get behind started developing though genuine murder mystery u uncover thing started move along became clear reveal would warrant time spent building side note think happy never see scene person questioned big bad behind everything say tell something worse death happen work stupid stalling technique build suspense audience satisfactory surprise pay end totally ridiculous needle say batman said pay biggest surprise end constantly one scene every way found batman lackluster movie somehow made nostalgic day schumacher,positive,38

"With a gargantuan running time and a sluggish plot. The Batman promises more than it actually delivers.The opening broody act does whet the appetite. This is a dark, moody and nihilistic take on the Dark Knight. An adult take on the comic book with elements of horror.Director Matt Reeves is inspired by David Fincher. This is a grungy rain soaked world.With the Riddler, Penguin, Falcone and Catwoman. It soon descends into throwing everything in the hope that something sticks.There are too many characters and not enough action. There is a chase sequence featuring the Penguin and that is about it.Robert Pattinson is wasted. His stunt double might have well be in the Batsuit. As Bruce Wayne he looks like an emo waster with a drug problem rather than a rich spoilt brat.There were issues with the main villains as well. The Riddler is just another take on Heath Ledger's Joker who just wants to see the world burn or in this case the streets of Gotham flooded.As for the Penguin. What was the point in hiring Colin Farrell if he was going to be covered in latex and a fat suit.The biggest insult and this is where I sympathise with Alan Moore's criticism of Warner Brothers. Once again a global media conglomerate is peddling the line that society is in trouble. Police and politicians are corrupt.The answer is for everything to go down in flames. There is a scene where the new mayoress goes out to help people but is attacked in a scene that holds a mirror to the 2021 Capitol Hill attack.Batman states he will learn and will do his best to improve society rather than look for vengeance. The film then sows the seeds for the sequel with a clown that has the same attitude as the Riddler.This is from a company which only believes in one thing.

The tone and color palette are incredible for the majority of the movie until they inexplicably change to a pastel for the final sequence, which is jarring, underwhelming and feels like a sequence from Batman Forever being stuck into a Tim Burton Batman film.Throughout the movie you feel like you really want to love it, you appreciate the quality of the production, and yet it feels soulless.The movie is over-long with some sequences being held for so long that I'd occasionally nod off.Batman is presented as a grounded emo-type loner who patrols the streets looking for signs of trouble, and his eventual reveal as Batman is quite basic. Yes, there is a scene in which he punches someone brutally, but the rest of the fight sequence is pedestrian.Batman works a case in a noirish setting as a semi-detective who tends to just stand still, brood and gaze intently at things. And Inspector Gordon relies so much on him that one wonders whether the viewer is missing some prodigious detective skills of his.The start of the investigation into a murder is drawn-out and, again, lacks any real punch.The Riddler starts off as very mysterious and well-executed. The main issue is that he disappears for the majority of the movie only to leave clues for Batman to solve, à la the Zodiac killer, but no genuine riddles. Once he reappears at the end, he seems to lack motivation for his actions and fails to appear anything other than a deranged child. One can see they were going for a similar disturbed edginess to Heath Ledger's Joker but it doesn't deliver. And his final plot of flooding Gotham doesn't appear to be of super-villain proportions and I failed to see the genius behind that plan. Like... why?Colin Farrell as Penguin and John Turturo as Falcons are brilliant. Bruce Wayne is too emo to appear as though he has any functioning life outside his mission as either a stalker or as Batman. Alfred is underused and his relationship with Bruce seems aloof. There is one scene at the hospital where the emotion finally sets in and it pulls at your heartstrings.I loved the backstory of Bruce's father. It was a great addition.Selina Kyle is excellent.As mentioned at the start, the finale is a real letdown and underwhelming. It feels like they wanted to do something big for the finale but it just feels tropey. It doesn't feel like a natural place the story would lead to. Zack Snyder, Christopher Nolan and Tim Burton were great with the final payoffs. This movie doesn't deliver that. It's a mind-bogglingly silly ""master plan"" by the Riddler. And the Riddler loses all his initial mystique in the third act of the film when he finally reappears.And don't get me started about the silly Joker tacked on at the end. You know the director is aiming for something nightmarishly disturbed and maniacal but it doesn't work. The Joker sounds like Jim Carrey and it's silly that it's him who says ""riddle me this"" instead of the Riddler. And their scene ends with childish maniacal laughter.Paterson plays Batman well. His voice is excellent and his voiceovers at the start are brilliant. It's just too bad they didn't use more of his narration throughout the movie; it would've worked a treat.The score is excellent although tends to primarily use the one theme with slight variations.Is the movie good? Your brain tells you that you are meant to say ""yes"" because there is a lot of quality in the film itself, but the sum of the parts is where it doesn't live up to its potential. It's over-long, poorly paced, with underdeveloped characters and a main villain who shows great promise at the start but ultimately underwhelms and the finale is jarring for all the wrong reasons. It isn't epic in any manner whatsoever although you know that's what they are trying for: but all they deliver is something tonally very different from the rest of the film, and the villainous plan is a head-scratcher due to its mediocrity.You will watch it once at the theatre and you will tell yourself ""I think it's good but I don't know why. Maybe I should watch it at home when it's released on home video so I can give it another go."" How many times will you watch it? Depends on your taste. Given how slow and long it is, my guess is that I'll only watch it one more time when it's released at home... but even then I'm unsure and not excited by that prospect.Did they make a mistake by making this movie? Not at all. I'm interested in such a different take and I'm happy it exists and that I got to watch it. It has some incredible moments.

"I wanted to love this movie. I would have settled for hating it. Instead, I was bored for three hours.The movie is a sloppy buffet of darkness, rain, gloom, unnecessary narration, wooden acting, absurd dialogue, pointless characters, canyon-wide plot-holes, unresolved story arcs, flaccid motivation for the bad guys, hyper-fast cuts, eye-rolling detective work, conventionally choreographed fight scenes, a cinematic emo aesthetic, a pseudo-Gothic mis en scene, a complete lack of humor or light-hearted moments of any kind, no soul in the acting, unsophisticated writing, timid directing, and a fully-checked list of boxes from the superhero / vigilante cliche playbook.This is a partial list of my complaints. (If pressed, I could probably find a handful of good things to say, but they'd be far too inconsequential to bail this movie out of the depths of Meh.)Having grown up on Adam West's Batman, I've lived through the campiness, the avant-garde, the silly, the surreal, and the downright brilliant (I'm looking at you Dark Knight). There have been Batman movies I've loved and ones I've hated. There are some Batman movies my family and I quote and admire and others we make fun of while we re-watch them to revel in their captivating absurdity. This is the first Batman iteration where I was disappointed, bordering on offended at the completely pedestrian effort and the unimaginative, forgettable final product.If you're under thirteen years old, a sucker for three hours of tedious brooding, and if you don't have a bone-deep familiarity with and love of the genre, you *might* enjoy this.

"Absolutely abysmal garbage. Everything sucks in this film. The best aspect of the film is the action which is meh, and it's the only aspect which is meh, everything else is plain trash. It's so full of cliches to the point that it's probably the most uninspired Batman film ever made, there is absolutely no originality in this film at all. The blandest versions of the characters I've ever seen, none of them are any interesting. Same plotlines all over again just way worse than usual. Songs are not fitting here at all. All the detective stuff is lame as hell and predictable that I made a few jokes about what it could mean or lead to and they turned out to be true when I wasn't even intending to predict anything. Romance is so surface level and basic, there's no chemistry in it at all. Important characters are so plot-armoured, it's beyond lame and stupid with a bomb exploding just a few centimetres from the face and not even a scratch or a character surviving a huge bomb exploding just 1 metre away from him and he only got scratched a bit. The physics are beyond ridiculous with the car chase having some absurd crap happening you'd normally expect to see in Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing. The film runs for 3 hours and almost nothing remotely interesting ever happens, I only liked 2 scenes that run for 10 seconds - when Batman got out of the car after the car chase and the hallway fight in the dark, and those two 10 second moments are the best this film has to offer. It's beyond boring and so generic. In fact, it was so crappy that I literally laughed out through the entire film, I laughed at how bad a ridiculous most of the stuff was, it's so terrible. But even with all my laughing, it was still so boring that I could barely sit it through. There are no values in this film whatsoever.",absolutely abysmal garbage everything suck film best aspect film action meh aspect meh everything else plain trash full cliche point probably uninspired batman film ever made absolutely originality film blandest version character ever seen none interesting plotlines way worse usual song fitting detective stuff lame hell predictable made joke could mean lead turned true even intending predict anything romance surface level basic chemistry important character plot armoured beyond lame stupid bomb exploding centimetre face even scratch character surviving huge bomb exploding metre away got scratched bit physic beyond ridiculous car chase absurd crap happening normally expect see big rig road racing film run hour almost nothing remotely interesting ever happens liked scene run second batman got car car chase hallway fight dark two second moment best film offer beyond boring generic fact crappy literally laughed entire film laughed bad ridiculous stuff terrible even laughing still boring could barely sit value film whatsoever,negative,45

"As director Matt Reeves repeatedly emphasized in several interviews before its release, ""The Batman"" is a detective noir with a dark atmosphere from beginning to end. If you look at scenes reminiscent of David Fincher's Se7en, the appearance of corrupt Gotham City's public power, politicians, and mafias, you also can enjoy this film as a crime drama. Godam City's gloomy appearance, created by director Matt Reeves, is fantastic. Thanks to the ability of Greg Fraser, the cinematographer of ""Rogue One"" and ""Dune,"" the overall visual beauty of ""The Batman"" is next level compared to average superhero movies. The script written by Matt Reeves and Peter Craig is also commendable. As soon as the movie begins, it welcomes the audience with an event that lays out the main plot of the film. Despite the 176-minute running time, which is nearly three hours long, there is no useless scene. It boldly omits Batman's origin and presents a young Batman who has only been active for two years. It feels as if Reeves is responding to criticisms imposed on Zack Snyder's Batman, such as ""He did not make good use of Batman's detective aspect"" and ""Batman is a murderer in this"". Reeves emphasizes Batman's 'Detective' identity as much as possible and shows the philosophy of ""not using a gun"" through dialogue and action.It does not make mistakes that ""Batman v. Superman"" made, such as packing too much storyline in the movie, or being too focused on setting up the sequel.Director Matt Reeves have teased a potential sequel, but at the same time, he argued that the first film should be able to work & stand on its own. Director Reeves' work, The Batman, succeeded in creating an impressive work with the story of Batman's growth, relationships with new characters, and Ridler's murder game. Warner Brothers, who had to go through a lot of critical or commercial failure due to excessive interference in the production of films such as Justice League and Suicide Squad, turned to guarantee the freedom of creators as much as possible. As a result, a work that reveals Matt Reeves' ambitious vision was born.Over the past few years, DC has disappointed a lot of people, and it is also true that it has become difficult to see DC go up to the same position as Marvel and compete with them. However, recently, films such as ""Joker"" and ""The Suicide Squad,"" masterpieces that utilize DC's unique personality and creator's vision have appeared, and ""The Batman"" seems to have no problem standing next to it. I hope that Matt Reeves will be able to complete a trilogy that utilizes his vision safely without following the path of SnyderVerse. Now DC has found its own way, not just copying Marvel. And ""The Batman"" is another step toward that path.",director matt reef repeatedly emphasized several interview release batman detective noir dark atmosphere beginning end look scene reminiscent david fincher se en appearance corrupt gotham city public power politician mafia also enjoy film crime drama godam city gloomy appearance created director matt reef fantastic thanks ability greg fraser cinematographer rogue one dune overall visual beauty batman next level compared average superhero movie script written matt reef peter craig also commendable soon movie begin welcome audience event lay main plot film despite minute running time nearly three hour long useless scene boldly omits batman origin present young batman active two year feel reef responding criticism imposed zack snyder batman make good use batman detective aspect batman murderer reef emphasizes batman detective identity much possible show philosophy using gun dialogue action make mistake batman v superman made packing much storyline movie focused setting sequel director matt reef teased potential sequel time argued first film able work stand director reef work batman succeeded creating impressive work story batman growth relationship new character ridler murder game warner brother go lot critical commercial failure due excessive interference production film justice league suicide squad turned guarantee freedom creator much possible result work reveals matt reef ambitious vision born past year dc disappointed lot people also true become difficult see dc go position marvel compete however recently film joker suicide squad masterpiece utilize dc unique personality creator vision appeared batman seems problem standing next hope matt reef able complete trilogy utilizes vision safely without following path snyderverse dc found way copying marvel batman another step toward path,positive,47
"The Batman is a very dark and gritty take that will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/ Batman is the best thing to happen in movie history. Zoe as Catwoman was superb, but the real star was Paul Dano as The Riddler. Paul as the Riddler was just so haunting definitely the best villain in a DC movie since Heath Ledger in 2008.The score was also fantastic. It was probably one of the best film scores I have heard in years. Best DC film since Joker for sure. I highly recommend this movie! If you want a movie that will have your mind thinking then this is the perfect movie.

"Yes, it may be the billionth Batman film in recent memory- but The Batman is easily among the best, if not the best, Batman films ever made. Everything works in this movie, and I mean everything. From the cinematography, to the visuals, set direction, score, acting, direction, writing- it never fails, and it never lets up. There are a few tiny predictable things here and there, but none really take an impact on the quality of the movie, nor the story its telling. It is 3 hours long, but the runtime passes fast, and honestly I never wanted it to end. Robert pattinson is just fantastic in this film, a Batman for the ages, and honestly my favorite film adaptation of the character yet. The rest of the supporting cast is also excellent, Jeffrey Wright bringing a new layer onto the character of Commissioner Gordon, as well as zoe Kravitz with her excellent portrayal of Selena Kyle (aka Catwoman). It's Paul Dano's Riddler that really takes the film by storm however, easily delivering the best villain performance in a superhero film in recent memory, whose zodiac style roots really intensify a new look to the iconic character. Colin Farrell is also excellent as the Penguin in the film, and I hope we get to see more use out of him in the future. Perhaps the most signature thing about this film is the look, a bleak and gritty look into Gotham's underworld, that really does- as director Matt Reeves said- push the limits of a PG-13 film. The look of the film is just outstanding and its hauntingly beautiful solemn poignancy is just wonderful to watch on screen- everything a true Batman fan would ever want. Not to mention the action and fight scenes throughout this film are just brilliant, easily breaking new ground, and capitalizing on its darker tone. In the end, I don't have enough words to say how much I loved The Batman. Again and again one word comes to be to describe it, extraordinary. It may seem familiar, but it's unlike anything you've seen before, and in the days of superhero movies- that's something really freaking rare.My Rating: 10/10.",yes may billionth batman film recent memory batman easily among best best batman film ever made everything work movie mean everything cinematography visuals set direction score acting direction writing never fails never let tiny predictable thing none really take impact quality movie story telling hour long runtime pass fast honestly never wanted end robert pattinson fantastic film batman age honestly favorite film adaptation character yet rest supporting cast also excellent jeffrey wright bringing new layer onto character commissioner gordon well zoe kravitz excellent portrayal selena kyle aka catwoman paul dano riddler really take film storm however easily delivering best villain performance superhero film recent memory whose zodiac style root really intensify new look iconic character colin farrell also excellent penguin film hope get see use future perhaps signature thing film look bleak gritty look gotham underworld really director matt reef said push limit pg film look film outstanding hauntingly beautiful solemn poignancy wonderful watch screen everything true batman fan would ever want mention action fight scene throughout film brilliant easily breaking new ground capitalizing darker tone end enough word say much loved batman one word come describe extraordinary may seem familiar unlike anything seen day superhero movie something really freaking rare rating,positive,51
"Someone is killing off senior political leaders in Gotham: the major, the chief of police, the district attorney. At the scene of each murder is found a note to Batman with a riddle and a clue to what is behind the murders. Batman's investigations lead him to a conspiracy that stretches back to when his father, Thomas Wayne, ran for mayor and, shortly after, was murdered.When this movie was first released I didn't have much regard for it. Superhero movies are dime-a-dozen and generally lacklustre, being all style and no substance. To make things worse, Batman is played by Robert Pattinson, an individual with no discernible acting talent and star of the massive pile of excrement that is Twilight.Now that I've watched it I must say I am very pleasantly surprised. Rather than consisting of mindless action scenes and no plot, this film is one of substance. The plot is clever and quite solid, resembling more of a detective/mystery drama than a superhero movie. Rather than rush from action scene to action scene, director Matt Reeves creates a dark, tense, slow-burning atmosphere reminiscent of David Fincher with visuals and action scenes that reminded me of a Frank Miller adaptation. Think Se7en meets Sin City.For the first two hours or so the only negative about the film was that it was maybe a touch too slow. In creating this atmosphere Reeves had slowed down the tempo too much. It was still brilliant though and looked set to be a masterpiece.Unfortunately, the last 30-40 minutes wreck any chances of the film being remembered more fondly. Reeves throws in one twist too many, a twist that takes us on an unfocused 30-40 minute digression. That last segment makes the film resemble more of an average superhero movie, with action at the expense of plot.Remove the final twist, have a tighter end to the mystery, lose 30 minutes or so at the end and this would have been an absolute masterpiece.

"2h56m runtime! Ugh, another movie that thinks it's an epic. News alert: The Batman ain't an epic, it's just too long. Another thing this movie isn't: entertainment fit for an adult mind. How many more batboy movies are there going to be? The comics were written for pre-teen boys, so why has this childish myth held on so long? Nothing new has been added to the story of batboy. And sorry folks, calling it ""The Batman"" adds nothing new.So much of the film is shot in the dark that I'd estimate that about forty percent of the color in the movie is black, meaning you can't see much. I see this so much in films these days and I just don't get it. If you aren't comfortable with images, maybe these directors would be happier working in radio. There are also scenes in which we are looking through windows and can't really see very well. I don't get it. It's like they used a camera from about 1910.The violence is completely ridiculous starting from the first scene in the subway. There is no explanation for the group of thugs ganging up on the guy leaving the train. Batboy shows up and beats them senseless, although I'm not completely sure because it was too dark to see much.You can't even see what his car looks like despite the fact that there is a five-minute car chase scene in which a fat guy in a normal car evades batboy for most of it.

"After seeing the trailer, I thought this film looked amazing but it turns out it is one of those movies that shows all the best parts in the trailer.It is hard to give this movie a 1 star rating because it is very well made but this is easily the most boring Batman film ever made. I enjoyed this movie even less than the Clooney version.The film has a good look for the most part and is like some of the comics but it is style over substance. The action scenes are very well done but they are very short and few between. If you saw the trailer, you have basically seen them and there will be no surprises.There are no characters in the movie you care about and Catwoman is annoying and physically unattractive yet they had to force a romance despite the actors having no chemistry.The Riddler is a serial killer that is murdering corrupt politicians. Do you really care that Batman stops him from killing these evil guys?One major thing this films lacks, especially considering it is a Batman movie, is a good villain. The Riddler is the main bad guy but he really isn't in the movie that much and never appears on screen with Batman. Even when he is caught, Batman watches outside a window as the police arrest him (this is somewhat shown in trailers). Batman later visits him in Arkham but they are once again separated by glass (also shown in the trailers).As for the acting, everyone just whispers in the movie, except for the Riddler who will randomly raise his voice in an attempt to act crazy.Thankfully, Robert Pattinson is no shown as Bruce Wayne much in the movie because he looks like Frankenstein's monster the times he is shown. You'd think it is a good thing to have so much Batman in a movie, but he mostly just stands around and whispers boring conversations.The worst thing about this movie is how boring it is. Batman is one of the most fun characters ever created but they sure managed to make him dull.",seeing trailer thought film looked amazing turn one movie show best part trailer hard give movie star rating well made easily boring batman film ever made enjoyed movie even le clooney version film good look part like comic style substance action scene well done short saw trailer basically seen surprise character movie care catwoman annoying physically unattractive yet force romance despite actor chemistry riddler serial killer murdering corrupt politician really care batman stop killing evil guy one major thing film lack especially considering batman movie good villain riddler main bad guy really movie much never appears screen batman even caught batman watch outside window police arrest somewhat shown trailer batman later visit arkham separated glass also shown trailer acting everyone whisper movie except riddler randomly raise voice attempt act crazy thankfully robert pattinson shown bruce wayne much movie look like frankenstein monster time shown think good thing much batman movie mostly stand around whisper boring conversation worst thing movie boring batman one fun character ever created sure managed make dull,negative,64
"I was able to see the movie yesterday. So let me start of saying that the movie is amazing.The tone and the visuals really hit different and it's a different Batman movie than all the previous iterations. Matt Reeves and Peter Craig really are a skilled writer set and the plot, the dialogues and even the humor are sharply written! Kudos to both of them. The score of the movie is amazing! Please do not listen to it before the movie. You need to hear and see the combination of visuals and the movie. It's full on amazing. Michael Giacchino has perfectly crafted a score for ages. In certain scenes I could feel my excitement and my adrenaline pump just because of the score. It's a very long movie, so it really does take its time in developing the story and the characters. I found myself liking the first 2/3s a bit more than the final stretch but overall it was amazingly told from start to finish.The visuals, fight scenes and the camera work is very well crafted too. There's no shaky cam scenes, no fight scene is shot too close. And one particular scene had my jaw dropping.I tried to avoid all the trailers and promo material to not spoiler the movie for me so I kind of went in not knowing and from the opening the movie turned out to be way darker than I expected it to be. But it's a good thing honestly and I am full on with it if it turns out to be a trilogy. And with that said people will try to compare it to TDK which in my opinion isn't fair because TDK was the second Part in a trilogy. This movie here should be compared to Batman Begins. And to answer the question. Yes I think it's better than Batman begins. And if Matt reeves can keep up the good writing and really develop the story even more we might have a better overall trilogy of Batman!And one more thing which I find very important. Since the movie is rated PG-13 i would still advise parents to have a second thought about taking younger children to the movies. It's a very dark movie and very intense. I personally think it's even a bit hard for some teenagers who might react sensitive to the themes and scenes of the movie.",able see movie yesterday let start saying movie amazing tone visuals really hit different different batman movie previous iteration matt reef peter craig really skilled writer set plot dialogue even humor sharply written kudos score movie amazing please listen movie need hear see combination visuals movie full amazing michael giacchino perfectly crafted score age certain scene could feel excitement adrenaline pump score long movie really take time developing story character found liking first bit final stretch overall amazingly told start finish visuals fight scene camera work well crafted shaky cam scene fight scene shot close one particular scene jaw dropping tried avoid trailer promo material spoiler movie kind went knowing opening movie turned way darker expected good thing honestly full turn trilogy said people try compare tdk opinion fair tdk second part trilogy movie compared batman begin answer question yes think better batman begin matt reef keep good writing really develop story even might better overall trilogy batman one thing find important since movie rated pg would still advise parent second thought taking younger child movie dark movie intense personally think even bit hard teenager might react sensitive theme scene movie,positive,65
"The movie begins painfully slow and continues like that for the first hour and every now and then it keeps its slow pace.The brown colors of the movie don´t allow to appreciate the costumes and the rest of things like the Batmobile.Even the movie title is shown in the most simplistic way that reminds of a 70´s bad film.WORST:The score is very slow for a Batman movie, and what I think is The Batman´s tune sounds like a ripoff of John William´s Imperial March (Darth Vader´s theme) but in a slower pace (throughout the movieI was thinking ""This tune whenever The Batman shows up, sounds"" very familiar until I remembered it from the first ""Star Wars"" trilogy.I am surprised that Giacchino wrote great scores for Tom Holland´s Spider-Man trilogy and the Star Trek remake and he failed miserably to this movie. The score is what puts you IN the right mood.ACTING:The acting by Farrell (The Penguin), Dano (The Riddler), Wright (Lt. Gordon), Turturro (Falcone) and Sarsgaard (D. A. Colson) was good.

"The production values are striking right from the first moments: dark, bleak and dystopian. And the crisp, direct dialogue added to the film noir effect, which was definitely a good sign.And then, and then: it just goes on and on, with the plot becoming ever more convoluted, the virtue signalling gets thicker and thicker, and the dialogue becomes more and more laughable.

"Greetings again from the darkness. Riddle me this: does ""The Bat, The Cat, and The Rat"" sound more like an opening line to a joke or the title of a Dr. Seuss book? In fact, those are three core elements of this new, COVID-delayed, and highly anticipated film from writer-director Matt Reeves and co-writer Peter Craig. I'll confess to being a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy (that concluded 10 years ago), and being a bit skeptical to a new version featuring Robert Pattinson in the titular role (I'm choosing to totally ignore the in-between portrayals in the ""Justice League"" movies). Knowing full well how important it is for fans to watch these films with fresh eyes and a clear head, this review is purposefully vague on what will surely prove to be some of the more popular and contentious discussion points.Let's start with a general description and the setup. The film is dark and gloomy and gritty and grimy. Gotham is a cesspool of corruption and crime, and we get no glimpse into the other side, assuming there is one. Billionaire Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) is still in his second year as the Batman, often referred to as ""Vengeance"". There is substantial backstory for Mr. Wayne, who lives in relative seclusion with his trusty manservant Alfred Pennyworth (Andy Serkis), while the Batman prowls at night in his efforts to clean up the city. Of course he is unable to keep pace with crime and corruption, even with the close alliance he has built with good cop, Police Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright). It takes Batman's Poirot-like detective skills to solve a riddle left as a clue in a particularly high-profile murder case. Soon it's obvious a serial killer is at work and he has purposefully drawn the Batman into his game.The caped crusader proceeds to cross paths with Selena Kyle/Catwoman (a terrific Zoe Kravitz), Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin (an unrecognizable Colin Farrell), District Attorney Gil Golson (Peter Sarsgaard), and crime lord Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). As city VIPs begin showing up dead, it's a masked Edward Nashton/Riddler (Paul Dano) who always seems a step ahead. All of the above receive their chance to shine on screen, and while none let us down, it's not until the mask is ripped from Riddler, and Dano really shines, that we are left wanting more. It should be noted that Farrell (with his facial prosthetics and fat suit) is kind of a second fiddle here, but it's surely intentional and meant to set the stage for more Penguin antics down the road.Pattinson will certainly receive the most scrutiny. I found him to be an excellent Batman, with black eye makeup smeared by sweat under his cowl, maintaining the grungy tone. His whispery voice differs from Christian Bale's gravely growl, but works for the character's withdrawn nature and preference for detective work over than fighting. Staying true to the premise that this is only his second year, there is a significant shortage of ""wonderful toys"", and the batmobile is less rocket ship and more souped-up coupe. The contrast to these is a batsuit that seems quite advanced (and looks cool). It's Pattinson's Bruce Wayne that didn't work for me. I respect the reclusive billionaire aspect, but he mostly looks like someone on their way to a Nirvana gig, leaving us wondering how the heck could anyone not connect the dots between a creepy rich guy and a nearly identical creepy guy in a bat suit. It's a minor complaint, but one that stuck with me.Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino (UP, 2009) takes a more classical approach than the dramatics of predecessors Hans Zimmer and Danny Elfman. Giacchino has been a frequent Pixar contributor, and scored some well-known blockbusters in franchises like 'Jurassic World', 'Star Trek', 'Planet of the Apes', 'Mission Impossible', 'Spider-man', and 'Star Wars'. His work fits nicely here. Adapting characters and stories originated by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, Matt Reeves and Peter Craig have found a way to put their own stamp on the work. Mr. Craig is Oscar winner Sally Field's son, and his previous scripts include THE TOWN (2010), parts 1 and 2 of THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY, and upcoming high-profile projects in TOP GUN: MAVERICK and GLADIATOR 2. Director Reeves has previously helmed the excellent horror film LET ME IN (2010), as well as DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (2014) and WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES (2017).This marks the first in a planned Batman trilogy, and a couple of the last scenes seemingly set the stage for what's to come. Although this is an odd movie, here's hoping the franchise maintains this tone and avoids the typical Marvel/DC overblown CGI approach. After all, the Batman is but one man, not a God of superpowers. This film is an unusual blend of noir-horror-detective-action-psychological thriller wrapped in a gray box with a black bow, and though it will likely be divisive among fans (isn't everything?), this 3-hour epic leaves us anticipating the next 'bat time' and 'bat channel'.Opens wide in theaters on March 4, 2022.",greeting darkness riddle bat cat rat sound like opening line joke title dr seuss book fact three core element new covid delayed highly anticipated film writer director matt reef co writer peter craig confess huge fan christopher nolan dark knight trilogy concluded year ago bit skeptical new version featuring robert pattinson titular role choosing totally ignore portrayal justice league movie knowing full well important fan watch film fresh eye clear head review purposefully vague surely prove popular contentious discussion point let start general description setup film dark gloomy gritty grimy gotham cesspool corruption crime get glimpse side assuming one billionaire bruce wayne robert pattinson still second year batman often referred vengeance substantial backstory mr wayne life relative seclusion trusty manservant alfred pennyworth andy serkis batman prowl night effort clean city course unable keep pace crime corruption even close alliance built good cop police lt james gordon jeffrey wright take batman poirot like detective skill solve riddle left clue particularly high profile murder case soon obvious serial killer work purposefully drawn batman game caped crusader proceeds cross path selena kyle catwoman terrific zoe kravitz oswald cobblepot penguin unrecognizable colin farrell district attorney gil golson peter sarsgaard crime lord carmine falcone john turturro city vip begin showing dead masked edward nashton riddler paul dano always seems step ahead receive chance shine screen none let u mask ripped riddler dano really shine left wanting noted farrell facial prosthetics fat suit kind second fiddle surely intentional meant set stage penguin antic road pattinson certainly receive scrutiny found excellent batman black eye makeup smeared sweat cowl maintaining grungy tone whispery voice differs christian bale gravely growl work character withdrawn nature preference detective work fighting staying true premise second year significant shortage wonderful toy batmobile le rocket ship souped coupe contrast batsuit seems quite advanced look cool pattinson bruce wayne work respect reclusive billionaire aspect mostly look like someone way nirvana gig leaving u wondering heck could anyone connect dot creepy rich guy nearly identical creepy guy bat suit minor complaint one stuck oscar winning composer michael giacchino take classical approach dramatics predecessor han zimmer danny elfman giacchino frequent pixar contributor scored well known blockbuster franchise like jurassic world star trek planet ape mission impossible spider man star war work fit nicely adapting character story originated bob kane bill finger matt reef peter craig found way put stamp work mr craig oscar winner sally field son previous script include town part hunger game mockingjay upcoming high profile project top gun maverick gladiator director reef previously helmed excellent horror film let well dawn planet ape war planet ape mark first planned batman trilogy couple last scene seemingly set stage come although odd movie hoping franchise maintains tone avoids typical marvel dc overblown cgi approach batman one man god superpower film unusual blend noir horror detective action psychological thriller wrapped gray box black bow though likely divisive among fan everything hour epic leaf u anticipating next bat time bat channel open wide theater march,positive,69

"""The Batman"" is a reboot of the titular DC superhero film franchise directed and co-written by Matt Reeves (""Cloverfield"", ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", ""War for the Planet of the Apes""). Starring Robert Pattinson in the lead role as well as Zoe Kravitz, Paul Dano, and Colin Farrell, it is the best Batman film to grace our screens that doesn't feature any involvement from Christopher Nolan.Two years after adopting the vigilante alter ego of ""Batman"", the young reclusive billionaire Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) is summoned by police lieutenant James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) to help investigate the murder of Gotham City's mayor on Halloween night. Upon closer inspection, they soon learn that this killer referring to himself as ""The Riddler"" (Paul Dano) intends to kill more important political figures, leaving behind cryptic messages for Batman in the process. After deciphering some of the messages, Bruce discovers that the Riddler's motivation for these murders runs deeper than he had thought, to the point where it involves not only Gotham City's hidden crime syndicate, but also his own family's legacy.Do I really need to give a detailed introduction to someone like Batman? He's one of the most iconic superheroes of all time and everybody and their dog knows who he is. There have been many films made over the years that feature the Caped Crusader's escapades against criminals, from Tim Burton's Michael Keaton-led movies that took the character more seriously to Christopher Nolan's Christian Bale-led The Dark Knight Trilogy that are often ranked among the greatest superhero films ever made. Now with Matt Reeves' vision being brought to life in ""The Batman"", we have yet another fantastic depiction of this popular hero in an engaging film that embraces his detective roots.Many people seem to forget that in addition to fighting crime with his fists and high-tech gadgets, Batman is also an accomplished detective. His strategy of using stealth to sneak around for clues as well as his superior powers of deduction are rivalled only by the likes of Sherlock Holmes. Unfortunately, this quirk hasn't really been touched upon in past movies, instead focusing on the action-based aspects of the character, likely because most casual audiences would find these moments more fun to watch. That is, of course, until now.I loved how this film makes Batman's detective work the focal point of the story. He is more pragmatic in how he tries to unravel the mystery of the Riddler's crimes, only using brute force when absolutely necessary. With that in mind, the film has clearly taken influence from the detective noir movies of many decades ago, like ""Chinatown"" and ""The French Connection"". Like those two examples, this one doesn't focus much on action but rather the main character's intellect to solve such an enigmatic puzzle. Personally, I enjoyed seeing this otherwise glanced-over character trait of Batman but I can understand why some audiences might not think the same way. As previously mentioned, there isn't as much action here as in other Batman films so I imagine there may be complaints from those who want more scenes of hand-to-hand combat.Another similarity this film has to classic noir fiction is its wonderful cinematography. There are many memorable shots that show Batman silhouetted among the skyline of Gotham City, often complimented by a beautiful colour palette to help him stand out. Noir does literally mean ""Black"" in French after all so this certainly fits a character like Batman to a tee. There's one scene that takes place almost entirely in the dark and the only form of light illuminating the characters is the gunfire. What would normally be difficult to see, given the circumstances, is made much more comprehensible thanks to Matt Reeves' slick direction. Reeves makes it clear that Gotham is rife with corruption and crime, emphasising this by showing how nobody is without sin. Though Bruce is a morally upstanding citizen, he too has skeletons in his closet regarding his family history. Likewise, even certain members of the police department are shown to have some ties to the criminal underworld.With all of these story elements coming together, it should be no surprise that there is a lot of ground to be covered. Because of this, the film ends up clocking in at just under three hours in length (176 minutes to be precise). Again, because of Matt Reeves' solid directing, by some miracle, he manages to make it all work so harmoniously within the given timeframe. The severity of the Riddler's murders taking place all over Gotham City actually aids in giving the film sufficient world building. We see a nightclub run by the local mafia, politicians lying about repairing what urgently needs to be fixed, and the media manipulating facts as a means to bring in ratings. As a result, Gotham feels like an actual location inhabited by real people, not simply because it has used obvious New York City landmarks as its basis (e.g. The Gotham State Building instead of the Empire State Building), but because they all echo true to the real world which can be just as much of a hellish place as something conceived in fiction, perhaps even more so.In addition to this, the Batman movies are also known for their unforgettable soundtracks. Tim Burton's films were complimented by Danny Elfman's energetic musical score while Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy benefited strongly from Hans Zimmer's grandiose use of horns and drums. It seems we can now add Michael Giacchino's dark, brooding music to the list of memorable Batman scores that many will remember years from now. The main theme definitely suits the film's despondent tone, complete with downbeat piano notes, giving it a haunting feeling that all is lost. I also liked how the film used Nirvana's ""Something In The Way"" to convey what is going through Bruce Wayne's mind. Its lyrics are a metaphor for being isolated from the rest of society, which is of course highly appropriate when considering Bruce's reclusive nature.There's no other working actor right now who could have played this particular incarnation of the Dark Knight better than Robert Pattinson (or ""Battinson"" if you will). Hopefully he can finally shed the shackles of that stigma he had being associated with the Twilight series since he now has this role to be proud of instead. Pattinson depicts Bruce Wayne as a deeply insecure man who is still reeling from the trauma of losing both his parents, and this is reflected in some of his inexperience when donning the superhero uniform. Usually whenever we see the Batman/Bruce Wayne dynamic, we are only ever shown Bruce's morose personality juxtaposed with Batman's one-track minded determination. Here, the lines are blurred as at times we can see some of Bruce's personal feelings getting in the way of his decision making as Batman. This presents an interesting point of vulnerability in the character that we don't tend to see, which makes him easier for the audience to identify with.Zoe Kravitz is also great as Selena Kyle/Catwoman. I've always enjoyed watching Catwoman's interactions with Batman throughout various forms of media and the ones in this film rank up there among the very best. The two have such believable chemistry since she is neither truly evil nor good, essentially making her an ideal grey area character. Despite being of different social classes, Kyle's downtrodden worldview resonates strongly with Bruce's equally pessimistic vision for the future of Gotham City. Naturally this leads to some great ""will they or won't they"" scenes that help bring a spark of hope that things could turn out for the better if they both worked together, but other matters always seem to prevent them from moving forward.As the film's main antagonist, Paul Dano puts his own intriguing spin on The Riddler. Instead of a man dressed in green wearing a hat with a question mark, Dano's Riddler is draped in a large poncho-like outfit and a mask that obscures his entire face. He is an intimidating figure who always seems to be at least five steps ahead of Batman and the police department. The riddles he leaves behind at the crime scenes are akin to that of the real-life Zodiac Killer, with complex patterns and codes that are hard to decipher at first glance. It was a clever idea to make allusions to that infamous murderer, especially since the mystery of who the Zodiac Killer really was remains unsolved to this day.Also playing an important role in the film is Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin. Like Batman himself, this version of The Penguin is still relatively inexperienced when compared to most other depictions in movies and TV shows. Farrell is completely unrecognisable in his makeup, so much so that I kept on forgetting it was him playing the character. I cannot discuss his significance in the story too much since that would give away important spoilers so all I will say is that he leaves just as much of an impression as the Riddler.Considering the high quality of its three predecessors, ""The Batman"" definitely had a lot to live up to in the wake they have left behind. What helped it achieve this with flying colours was the atypical direction it took things in. By primarily harkening back to its detective-focused origins, we have something that works both as a superhero film and a neo-noir film all rolled into one. On top of that, we also have a unique portrayal of the main character by Robert Pattinson to solidify the film's legacy as one of the best in the entire franchise. According to Matt Reeves, there are sequels confirmed to be on the way so if he is able to recapture lightning in a bottle, then exciting times lie ahead.I rate it a solid 9/10.",batman reboot titular

"This is essentially a film noir, Batman meets Sin City, mash up.Its experimental and in its own way, quite daring. For that and the fact it mostly works, I give it kudos. I'm equally impressed, by the suitably downbeat performances, from Robert Pattinson and Zoë Kravitz.The actors understand the kind of film they are in and adjust their performances, accordingly. That's not as easy as it sounds, given the glitzy, action packed handling, of previous ""Batman"" outings and the expectation, it creates.I'm afraid however, there is a ""but"" coming. This film basks a little too long, in its dark, fantasy world. Its a beautifully shot world, the cinematic's moodily excellent. That said, it could have been 30 minutes or so shorter and worked just as well.I think too, its clever in so much as they re-create old characters like the Penguin and Riddler, making them more human and relatable. That said, I would have used new characters, with a fresh perspective. This is after all, a departure from what Batman has been in the past, for the most part.Lastly, a there's little dash of throw away, anti ""white"" rhetoric, I could have done without.In summary, a mixed bag. Experimental in a positive way but lingers a little too long. Inexplicably, still sticks to the Batman character universe script, even when departing from it.6/10.",essentially film noir batman meet sin city mash experimental way quite daring fact mostly work give kudos equally impressed suitably downbeat performance robert pattinson zo kravitz actor understand kind film adjust performance accordingly easy sound given glitzy action packed handling previous batman outing expectation creates afraid however coming film basks little long dark fantasy world beautifully shot world cinematic moodily excellent said could minute shorter worked well think clever much create old character like penguin riddler making human relatable said would used new character fresh perspective departure batman past part lastly little dash throw away anti white rhetoric could done without summary mixed bag experimental positive way lingers little long inexplicably still stick batman character universe script even departing,positive,73
"There's so much wrong with this movie. The first major problem is that it doesn't understand Batman. Batman Forever understood Batman better than this crap. Robert Pattinson plays Bruce Wayne as if he were an emo who spends his days locked in his dark room listening to Nirvana and My Chemical Romance. He doesn't even act like a human. He's like an edgelord teenager. I defended the casting choice leading up to the release of the film, but after seeing it I need to go back and delete every comment defending the casting of Pattinson.Second problem is Catwoman. Not the performance, but the character herself. She adds nothing to the film and the ""romance"" between her and Batman was so forced as there was never any chemistry between the two ""heroes."" The scenes with her are absolutely the most uninteresting and I think it would have benefitted greatly if she was removed so the movie was shorter and more focused on Batman being the detective and going against Penguin and Riddler. The pacing is already super slow but every scene with Catwoman feels like they stretched one page of screenplay into five minutes of film.Riddler is okay. I like Paul Dano. He doesn't get a lot to do. Penguin actually ended up being more interesting and he was given even less to do.Jim Gordon in this movie is terrible. Easily the worst character. All he does in this movie is read clues out loud and go ""What does this mean???"" And then Batman figures everything out. It's so boring.This is probably a 3/10 movie, but the fact that it's getting such good reviews infuriates me. I hate knowing that this is the future of Batman and Ben Affleck won't be getting his solo movie now after being replaced by an emo loser version of Bruce Wayne. I'm not saying Batman v Superman was great or anything but my God it was better than this by miles. At least it was made by people who are clearly fans of the characters. Everyone in this movie other than Colin Farrell and Paul Dano seem like they're miserable to be in the movie.This movie is boring and pretentious but has somehow convinced people it's a masterpiece. It's not. It's like the Batman version of Blade Runner 2049 but without the skill behind the camera that Denis Villeneuve brings to his movies. He understands how to make slow movies feel epic and inspiring.

"Complete and utter self serving trash. From the ridiculous haircut to the fact Batman is a skinny emo kid and that's not even mentioning the awful looking action scenes and terrible CGI when it is used. There are huge portions of the movie with little to nothing happening. If The Watchmen, Saw and Prisoners had a love child this would be it but not in a good way. Not even close in substance to any of those movies but tries to imitate the style and tone of each right down to the voice over narration, Paul Dano, clues about clues about clues, riddles etc. It seems all you have to do to score high reviews is to make something dark and gritty. Honestly how Pattinson is meant to be physically capable of dominating anyone is laughable never mind Zoe Kravitz all 5 ft 3 and 100lbs of her knocking guys out with single kicks then getting battered and choked out by a pensioner?

"First of all, let's all agree that Pattinson is a good actor. However, this does not mean that every good actor can impersonate any fictional character. Some fictional characters require certain traits that need to be present in the actors that portray them. Batman is one of the darkest, toughest, meanest, manliest, scariest, most well-built, most brutal, most deeply voiced, smartest, best strategy making characters that have ever been created. In other words, Batman is the ultimate human male (without superpowers). Such features are simply not present in Pattinson, genetically speaking. On the contrary, his genetic features are somewhat feminine. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it simply is the opposite of the character's profile. No matter how tough he may try to sound, how much muscles he puts on and how much steroids he ends up putting in his system, he simply does not fit the profile. To put things into perspective, let's ask a question. Can Pattinson portray the Punisher? The answer is a simple and plain ""NO!"" Why? Because he simply isn't tough enough! Batman is the punisher on cosmic steroids. He's way tougher, smarter, stronger, and darker. The reason people sometimes overlook this fact is because of Batman's moral code. So if Pattinson can't even portray the Punisher, how the heck do you cast him as the Goddamn Batman?!!Even though the movie was trying too hard to convince the viewers that this Batman was intimidating, well, ""spoiler alert"", he's not! Not even a little bit. In some scenes, you actually feel sorry for the character, which is such a shame. Of course, the main reason behind this is that the guy who's playing the character isn't. Not only did Batman lack brawn in the movie, he also lacked brains! Everybody's talking about how this movie perfectly portrays Batman as ""the world's greatest detective"". Sorry guys, but if this is what ""the world's greatest detective"" looks like to you, you should definitely read more Batman comics and maybe some Agatha Christie books too. I mean, seriously, the guy had no clue what a carpet tucker was! How the heck are people even comparing the detective work in this movie to Se7en? What was presented here wasn't even the ABCs of detective work. It was pathetic, and Batman was slightly less of an idiot than the cops around him. His suit overall was not good. He literally looked flat in it. I liked the fact that it's bullet proof, but that's about it. The cowl is the worst thing about it. It's cheap, too revealing, and makes Batman's head look like an Easter egg! I really liked the camera lenses though; that was a brilliant addition. The adrenaline shot was a good idea too. It makes total sense, and I can't remember it ever being used on the silver screen. The batmobile was another thumbs up. But wait, I have to talk about the stupid point of Batman using the front door! I mean, seriously, what the hell was Reeves even thinking? Batman is the world's greatest ninja. If he wanted to get into someplace he wasn't welcome, he'd sneak in, get whatever he needed and leave without anyone ever noticing!Believe it or not, Catwoman's casting in this flick was a much better choice than Batman's! Zoe almost fits the character's full profile. She's agile, flexible, mysterious, seductive, with sharp exotic features. Maybe a bit too exotic, but that isn't really an issue. The real issue with her is that she's too small and thin, which makes her look too fragile against her foes, making her fight scenes seem unrealistic to the viewers. But I guess they had to cast a tiny actress for the role, especially since the dude who's playing Batman is a whimp.Colin Farrell as the Penguin. Wow! Just wow! This guy took the character to a completely new level. I think it's safe to say that this is my favorite Penguin adaptation ever. Maybe even better than the comics! Farrell's acting is so good, it makes you forget that he's actually playing the character. Turturro's Falcone was spot on too. They both looked like they came straight outta The Godfather!I don't usually like it when they change anything about a comic book character, such as their ethnicity, simply because I like the live-action representation of the character to be as close to the comics as possible. But in Wright's case, I'm actually glad they did. He simply nailed the character.Now let's talk about the movie. The cinematography was really good and I really liked the film's noir theme. The score was amazing too, which added more depth to the movie's theme. Reeve's direction was good, but had its flaws. The script was very basic and lacked layers of depth. Paul Dano as The Riddler and Andy Serkis as Alfred were decent, but nothing special. The movie's runtime was way too long (it should've ended at least 30 minutes earlier). And then there's the ending.. that stupid motorcycle race between Batman and Catwoman looked like something out of a cheap Indian movie.

"5 out of 5 stars.The Batman is an electrifying dark superhero film and dives into an psychological crime story. Director Matt Reeves takes this film into a whole new dark direction. So dark that every scene seems faded or taking place in a night raining setting. The script and narration in the beginning sets the tone of the film. With Bruce Wayne giving a narrative about how he brings fear that every criminal stays away from the shadows. The film is one awesome superhero film. Watching it the first time may not be enough with so much to digest on what is going on with the depth layer of the story. For a 3 hour run time, the film packs so much that it never once felt long.The script and direction is great. Dark atmospheric setting. Showing Gotham a city that is on a ticking time bomb with crime happening. Nirvana's song playing a couple of times setting that mood of the film. Which is dark and setting that depressing mood. But it works great. The action sequences are great. The fight scenes are well choregraphed. The villains Riddler played by Paul Dano is great. Riddler played more like a zodiac killer. The direction plays like a crime solving film with Batman being detective and on the trail of the riddler. Leading Batman investigating criminal syndicates like Falcone (John Turturro) and Penguin (Colin Farrell). And catwoman (Zoe Kravitz) assisting him with the investigation. The film gritty and grounded with its action sequences. The car chase was awesome with the cinematography being close to the action as possible.Robert Pattinson is great as a dark version of Bruce Wayne. And great as Batman. Paul Dano is good. John Turturro, Colin Farrell, Zoe Kravitz, Andy Serkis, and Jeffrey Wright were all great with there roles.The cinematography and music score were great. The film does have one brief scene that hints towards another film. The film has a deep depth story that packs a lot and ties a lot together.

"Is anyone surprised this was coming? For years, the comic book nerds have groused about a) why Bruce Wayne isn't so troubled by the death of his parents b) he doesn't do any detective workSo we get Emo Batman. Sunk deep into bleak variations on grunge pop Nirvana's ""Something In The Way"" it draws a doom and gloom march towards the unveiling of a serial killer in Gotham City. There are also nods to ""Seven"" & ""The Crow"" two films that have constant rain and a dark presence hovering over its dirty city.Some of the details of the Wayne's history is baffling. Perhaps I've not read the comics those are based on. Particularly his Father past nor his Mother's, which implies a Kennedy connection there, in terms of wealthy people burying their shame. Regardless of the attempt to clean up some of the darkness that haunts the Wayne family, none of their justification by way of Alfred (Andy Serkis) doesn't absolve guilt in any way. Which leaves you feeling off-put by our perception of what certain people meant to the city. In some ways, the movie actually asks you to forgive.For the most part, Robert Pattinson does very well when he dons the cowl. Once out, he seems to be a reject from The Cure. Much like Brandon Lee. His dead eyes match his dead soul. And director Matt Reeves is decisive when it comes to not showing the joys of wealth. A point which is made when we find out why the Riddler exists.Paul Dano does well as the Riddler. Though doesn't stray too far from Heath Ledger's Joker. Which is a shame. At a certain point, they could be interchangeable. A flaw I've always seen with both characters. And Colin Ferrell's Penguin bellows wildly like Robert DeNiro's Al Capone in ""The Untouchables (1987). A very easy connection. Even looks like him.I felt Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman was a massive misstep. She seems to be cut-and-paste here. Something is missing in her performance that separates all the other ones. A sexuality that oozes through the screen. Like every story prior to this has her story changed but she still is alluring. Kravitz does not have that quality. Many moments of sexual innuendos to be mined, but fall flat due to Hollywood's lack of courage to just make a fun movie that have Batman and Catwoman flirt. This doesn't want that. So what is their attraction? One wonders.All in all, children will not get this Batman police procedural. It's coming at an angle where it may be a long t.v.series, but doesn't have the sense of comic book quality the predecessors had to make it a cinematic adventure.I do like they went with something different. And perhaps this is what is lacking for me. For others, it may be a refreshing change of pace from the wildly comical Batmans.

"3 hours. I sat through 3 hours of this. OMG when you think Batman, you think Superhero movie, you think Action, you think excitement.If that's what you are looking for, don't waste your time with this movie.1) Bruce Wayne and Alfred are like family. Alfred Raised Bruce from childhood. When Bruce says to Alfred ""You are not my father"", that is just wrong on so many levels. Bruce treats Alfred like crap only caring just before he is almost killed.2) Whenever Batman just walked into a crime scene, or the bar, I felt like I was watching the Adam West Batman from the 60's. Batman is supposed to be Sullen and work/move in the shadows. Not walk into a crime scene filled with cops and just stand there. Nor does he Knock on the door of a bar to gain entry and ""ask"" to see the Penguin.3) EMO Bruce Wayne was just BORING. Bruce Wayne is a flashy playboy rich kid which he does to dissuade suspicion of him being Batman. This Emo take is just dull4) Sullying the memory of Thomas Wayne was just wrong. Thomas & Martha Wayne were the ideal parents while they were alive. They cared about their city. There is no way he would have ever turned to Falconi.5) All the fight scenes, with the exception of the last one in the arena, were all slow and almost uneventful.6) Movies like this seriously need to stop trying to ""Shoe in"" messages from today's world. Movies are supposed to take you out of every day life for a while and suspend belief. When Catwoman tells Batman they need to punish these damn old white privilege men, that just ended the ""fantasy"" of this movie and turned it into a political statement. As did the whole Corrupt old white mayor was killed, and in comes the black female Mayor to ""Save the city"". Oh the Black mayor does get sniped in the last battle, but less than 5 min later is perfectly fine. No injury, loss of blood, anything.The few good points of the movie.

"Approaching this review holistically as my favorite Batman is Kevin Conroy (sorry live action movies) - my credentials - an average fan, have read most of the Detective and Batman comics, watched most the DC animated shows and movies as well as live action films and played all the Arkham games and also the Telltale series.To avoid spoilers, just commenting on the actual acting more than plot.I didn't like the Batman voice but midway through it grew on me. Acting wise Mr Pattinson is impressive (but my favorite roles of his are as Neil, Cedric Diggory and Rev. Teagardin) - as Batman, remember this is Bats in year 2 and Mr Pattinson nails it as well. A fine actor (not better than Mr Keaton but that is childhood nostalgia maybe however just as batty as Mr Bale..Mr Affleck was awesome as well but scripting for him was below par).Ms Kravitz was maybe born to play Selina (at least this gritty version). I honestly disliked Ms Kravitz in X-Men and Grindlewald but liked her in Big Little Lies. I was skeptical given her lack of martial arts but it is evident she gave her best during training and for me, her portrayal of Selina was perfect. Chemistry wise though, needed some work between Bats and Cats but nothing worth losing a star over.Mr Dano, wow; Saw like sadist perhaps inspired by Mr Spacey a bit, a Riddler far from the kooky ""riddle me this"" we have come to know and enjoy but he gave in a performance no less than his stellar efforts with Daniel Day Lewis. I have become a fan of Mr Dano's acting.Mr Serkis, just when I thought a re-imagining might go awry, there is Mr Serkis. He portrays Alfred so naturally, it's as if he is Alfred Pennyworth.Mr Wright is a fair enough Gordon and without any fault of his, once you've seen him as Felix Leiter (as he was the best Leiter for me) it's hard to not compare his take on Gordon with Leiter. Also once you've seen Mr Oldman in and as anything...well Mr Oldman is my best Gordon (like Mr Simmons is my best JJJameson).Mr Farrell was a believable budding Cobblepot and I hope he brings the same effort to the supposed spinoff (suffice to say I also had enjoyed his take on Bullseye..but InBruges is till my best for Mr Farrell).Mr Turturro is limited but still impactful as was Mr Skarsgard.Direction/Plot - I appreciate good work and Mr Reeves clearly put in an honest effort. I enjoyed his vision and never felt bored or distracted whilst watching his movie. He is not Mr Nolan or Mr Burton or Mr Timm/Mr Dini, but a league of his own and in this, he owned it. Thank you for not messing it up.Story wise the movie is entertaining and well made - there is a threat, hero and allies must work to show their relevance and save the day - done quite effectively (not life changing but films rarely are, however storytelling is meaningful). Obviously production values are impressive and the cinematography is amazing. Set designs are useful while costumes are well thought out and used relevantly.Overall - 10 out of 10 from me.Vinaka from Fiji.",approaching review holistically favorite batman kevin conroy sorry live action movie credential average fan read detective batman comic watched dc animated show movie well live action film played arkham game also telltale series avoid spoiler commenting actual acting plot like batman voice midway grew acting wise mr pattinson impressive favorite role neil cedric diggory rev teagardin batman remember bat year mr pattinson nail well fine actor better mr keaton childhood nostalgia maybe however batty mr bale mr affleck awesome well scripting par m kravitz maybe born play selina least gritty version honestly disliked m kravitz x men grindlewald liked big little lie skeptical given lack martial art evident gave best training portrayal selina perfect chemistry wise though needed work bat cat nothing worth losing star mr dano wow saw like sadist perhaps inspired mr spacey bit riddler far kooky riddle come know enjoy gave performance le stellar effort daniel day lewis become fan mr dano acting mr serkis thought imagining might go awry mr serkis portrays alfred naturally alfred pennyworth mr wright fair enough gordon without fault seen felix leiter best leiter hard compare take gordon leiter also seen mr oldman anything well mr oldman best gordon like mr simmons best jjjameson mr farrell believable budding cobblepot hope brings effort supposed spinoff suffice say also enjoyed take bullseye inbruges till best mr farrell mr turturro limited still impactful mr skarsgard direction plot appreciate good work mr reef clearly put honest effort enjoyed vision never felt bored distracted whilst watching movie mr nolan mr burton mr timm mr dini league owned thank messing story wise movie entertaining well made threat hero ally must work show relevance save day done quite effectively life changing film rarely however storytelling meaningful obviously production value impressive cinematography amazing set design useful costume well thought used relevantly overall vinaka fiji,positive,82

"As ""The Batman"" (2022 release; 176 min.) opens, it is ""Thursday, October 31"", and the Mayor of Gotham City is watching a city election debate on TV, only to then be killed by the Riddler. In a parallel story, Batman breaks up a gang in the streets of Gotham City. ""Who the hell are you?"" asks one of them. ""I am the vengeance"", responds Batman. At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this latest Batman is the vision of director and co-writer. Matt Reeves (""Let Me In"", ""War of the Planet of the Apes""). Let's get straight to that vision: it is darker as any other Batman I've seen, both literally and figuratively. Indeed, Batman avoids the daylight as much as possible (it hurts his eyesight), and much of the movie features a dark and very damp Gotham City. Batman himself cones across cold and aloof. Are you getting the overall sense? I fully realize that I am in the minority here, but when all was said and done, I didn't enjoy or care for ""The Batman"" all that much. It's too calculating and distant. Not too mention, it's way, way, way too long. The movie could easily have been trimmed by half an hour without losing any of its core narrative.""The Batman"" opened in theaters in early March but it was widely known that it would start showing on HBO and HBO Max a mere 45 days later, and that is where I saw it just the other days.

"I was really enthusiastic about Reeve's interviews, it finally seemed like his version would be more accurate to the comics, which I think it's been failing long enough with Batman movies.The dark detective noir story is there, in fact, and there's some great atmosphere with the first 15 minutes of the movie totally exciting me about how this was going.The settings and cinematography of the movie are really great, I absolutely loved that aspect of this movie, and the design of Batman suit doesn't look that bad in the dark even though it's definitely not my favourite live action version.Now, I really wanted to like Pattison's version of the character, I like a lot of his work, but this is an absolute miss. I thought so from the very first news of his casting, but I kept hopeful for a surprise that didn't come.As batman, he's definitely not imponent, his un-athletic frame and skinny legs wouldn't impose fear to a little girl, it really annoys me that he didn't put any effort on the physical side of his character (which is SO important for this role!), you can tell he didn't do any serious exercise when you see his torso and arms naked. I'm sure he got paid enough to have done better than that, it's almost disrespectful. And before you think ""oh, but this is Batman starting, he gets bigger later"": WRONG! He trains for years in Asia before he gets back and he's fully prepared physically, what he gains through being Batman in Gotham is experience, knowledge and new gadgets.In terms of performance, his Bruce Wayne is pretty much an emo, which is all the opposite to what the character does in the comic books to get as far away from suspicion as possible. Another miss. He never shows his sadness and tortured personality as Bruce Wayne.Not the looks, not the performance.The fights were somehow cool, mostly thanks to the cinematography, but after the first fight when Bats uses one of his ""weapons"", he totally forgets about his belt and doesn't do anything else than punching and kicking, and I don't find that satisfying enough, Batman's gadgets is one of the things that give him advantage over any other fighter or a bunch of fighters. It's a disappointment to see how the director thought about Batman's technology for his detective work but almost nothing on his fighting.In terms of villains, there were moments where Riddler was creepy enough to give chills, but it fell flat in the end. Penguin didn't strike in any particular way, even though Farrell is a great actor, the character felt washed down and wasted for me, lacking a lot of his classic characteristics.Catwoman looks good but also, didn't felt much like the comic book, could definitely have done more in such a long run of a film.I feel these realistic takes of Batman are killing the character in movies, I don't know why directors and writers fill their mouths saying they're fans and they want to be faithful to the comics and they make Batmans that can't do anything of what the character normally does.I whish someone would chill out a bit and make it a bit more fantastic within the character's characteristics.This one in particular is even more realistic than Nolan's, and for me, that's a very bad thing, I had enough of normal guys walking around in a useless armour throwing punches standing like robots.I can only hope this director is saving the gargets and abilities aspect for future movies, to show improvement and evolution on the character, but I think it could have been done in THIS movie, being over two and half hours there was more than enough time to show it!As a movie is not bad, but neither great. The pace is too slow, it really drags by times, with long, redundant conversations, repetitive scenes and the characters not too well adapted, specially Pattison's Batman.Another disappointment for me, because I keep waiting for a proper adaptation of the Batman from the comic books, as there's never been one.I whish Affleck would have done his take, with Deathstroke, his cool Batsuit, more action, more fun.

"It's no longer possible to trust IMDB reviews because they are full of shills either paid or otherwise, pushing product. This is a real review by a real person who just saw the movie.Overall, this movie isn't bad. It's not particularly good, either. I was very worried Robert Pattison would suck as Batman. He didn't. He wasn't great, either. The fact is none of the actors were given much to do. The emotional arc of all the characters is practically flat.The plot is also paper thin. There is no reason for this to be a Batman movie. What it seems like to me is someone's mediocre pycho-thriller spec script got dusted off, had Batman characters inserted into and (Bang! Pow!) we got a blockbuster movie!!! As others have pointed out this movie steals everything in sight from 'Seven'. It totally lacks the atmosphere. Creepiness and emotional punch, though.The two biggest visual cliches' of 21st Century cinema are over the top CGI use and excessive digital filter use. This movie spares us the first but drowns us in murkiness with the second. NO modern filmmaker seems to understand that you need to have an effective use of both LIGHT and shadow to create an engaging atmosphere. It's about pushing the exposure of the film not just making everything dark in post. This movie is just ridiculously gloomy and lacking in pop.Paul Dano is totally wasted. The writers give him nothing to do. He is a generic 'John Doe' ripoff. It's too damn bad. I thought he could've done something great with The Riddler but there was nothing in the writing to support him and his character design is non-existent.Likewise, Batman, could've been some outcast (but brilliant, we're led to believe) detective/sleuth who gets brought in from the outside to help with a case. There is no real reason in the plot for him to be Batman. The action scenes seem tacked on. There is no relationship between Bruce Wayne and Alfred, so Andy Serkis is totally wasted as well.There is also a ridiculous amount of padding in the story. A half hour to 45 minutes could've been trimmed off it and the pacing would've been much better.There is a Grunge overtone to the production and I wonder what Kurt Cobain would've thought of his music being used as a theme for a super hero movie.Like I said, it wasn't horrible but all the rave reviews are nonsense. I checked the time on my phone twice during this thing. Three times and I usually get up and leave. I didn't leave and the movie was engaging enough to keep me in my seat. However, this is not a movie I'm going to buy to add to my collection. You can get it all in one sitting.It looks like they were fishing for a sequel at the end but I really hope that doesn't happen.

"The Batman feels like the definitive take on the titular caped crusader. A sprawling, dark and epic story that finally puts Batman's detective skills front and centre whilst having ample commentary on today's society.Robert Pattinson gives a perfect lead performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman that's different to what's come before. A Bruce Wayne who only lives to be Batman and carries a visible pain and trauma in every scene. He also manages to do so much with so little, able to convey a lot with just a simple look or turn.ZoÃ« Kravitz is an excellent Catwoman with her own pain and history and has all the necessary charisma and style. Paul Dano is an absolutely terrifying Riddler, having plenty of unsettling and loud outbursts of rage skillfully counterbalanced with quiet whispers.Also notable performances include an unrecognisable Colin Farrell, Jeffrey Wright, who is a superb Gordon and surprisingly active. Andy Serkis' Alfred, who manages to do a lot with a little and John Turturro who is icily cold and satisfyingly restrained as Carmine Falcone.Matt Reeves' direction is incredible, Gotham is at its most fully realized with a nice balance of realism and comic book extravagance. Action sequences are all extremely unique and are therefore able to standout with the car chase in particular being an unforgettable set piece.The pacing is also perfect, able to make it's three hour runtime fly by due to something always happening without feeling rushed.

"I honestly don't understand why this movie got such a high grade.It's darker than previous movies and I understand the comics setup for many scenes.There are some trully stupid elements there. For example the whole video conversations and the meaningless chase after the riddler. With today's technologies (and yes, they use modern cellphones), it's a matter of moments for any tech company that provide the service to pin point the location, registry etc. For some reason, not a single character had figured it out. Not even the batman himself.All characters speak in cliches, which makes them even more stupider to observe and give nothing to the story.Casting is off entirely except Zoe Kravetz as Selena and Colin Farrel as Penguin. Script is dumb to say the least.The only positive is the dark comics setup, which we can live without in the movies.

"The batman character is not developed in the film, it just clumsily sets the stage with narration of batman's internal monologue that is directed towards the audience with exposition.Batman's entire role in the film is to stare dramatically at people, slowly lifting his eyes and whispering his lines.

"There's nothing redeeming about this film except for Colin Farrell and John Turturro roles as the bad guys.

He was able to send me to college where I studied very hard got my degree. Like many people I worked hard at many jobs. When the economy collapsed I was laid off in 2008 until 2013, and when I finally found a job I had it for just 6 years before losing that job during the pandemic. Because of economic collapse and covid-19 I've spent 8 of the last 25 years unemployed. If that's white privilege, then it doesn't amount to much privilege. Being white isn't a golden ticket.

During those years of unemployment I depended on food pantries, I didn't get any food stamps, I was lucky enough to get by with friends, family and the kindness of strangers.Allowing Zoe Kravitz Catwoman to talk about ""White privilege"" so cavalierly in this film is a huge insult to millions of White people who work hard, suffer and die just trying to care for their families and live and be happy without being insulted by privileged and out-of-touch, rich, insulated, pampered, spoiled, WOKE movie stars.",nothing redeeming film except colin farrell john turturro role bad guy interesting character offended catwoman dismissal race white father worked hard well throughout hard life able send college studied hard got degree like many people worked hard many job economy collapsed laid finally found job year losing job pandemic economic collapse covid spent last year unemployed white privilege amount much privilege white golden ticket sometimes mean poor struggle paycheck paycheck mean part lower class often year unemployment depended food pantry get food stamp lucky enough get friend family kindness stranger allowing zoe kravitz catwoman talk white privilege cavalierly film huge insult million white people work hard suffer die trying care family live happy without insulted privileged touch rich insulated pampered spoiled woke movie star,positive,133

"I will get right to it. As many people feared, Robert Patterson is not good enough to pull this role off. Not only does he always appear, even in the mask, to be young.... he has no commanding presence. In fact, he hardly talks at all. I am sure the director cut his dialog after finding out he came off badly. It is a mystery as to why Gordon trust's him but it will remain a mystery because we don't get any background on their relationship.Is Gotham on a tropical island? It rains in EVERY SCENE. Monsoon rain. This is obviously to hide special effects. But it is so obvious and annoying.The screenplay is wildly bloated and unfocused. Leading to just about everyone not getting proper character development. As many have noted, the movie comes to its climax and then, has a tacked on ending, that really doesn't advance anything but I think was put there because they realized that Batman hadn't had enough action.Bruce Wayne is not Bruce Wayne. He is an emo hermit with frankly... an intense sense of entitlement. After Alfred wakes up from a bomb (meant for Bruce) does Bruce tell him he loves him? Nope -- he immediately starts questioning Alfred about why Alfred didn't tell him the truth. I mean he is Marcia Brady, me me me me me... levels of childishness. I know reviewers said that he learned lessons but I sure didn't see that on the screen. Just blank stares.Batman goes around virtue signaling that he doesn't kill bad guys with guns but then proceeds to engage in a wrong way chase on a highway (for nothing really) that ends with a massive explosion of gas trucks. Um, how many innocents died or were hurt there?There are too many ""bad guys"" in this move.

"A few things about this movie were absolutely insane. They ruined Alfred completely. Bruce Wayne is a Super Rich Playboy in EVERY batman movie, he is charming and always goes after a girl. This one he is some little cry baby, who gets saved by his little girlfriend?? Batmobile was a muscle car Yawn,, and all we get is some cheap scene straight outta fast and the furious. Trying too hard to be Too Dark. It was almost comical how serious it was trying to be. This movie has 3 endings, feels like its 5 hours long which usually isnt a good sign. I kept asking myself ""when is this over"" They ruined riddler turning him into some cheap Zodiac killer wanna be. Its like the movie Seven and dark city had a baby. For over 3 hours long i cant even remember one memorable scene.. Oh he comes out of an elevator and beats people up... LAME. Nothing was explained about his past like we are supposed to know everything and the score was TERRIBLE (sorry) the same ominous tone over and over. Darth Vader would be proud.

"I love Batman, Michael Keaton in Batman Returns set the iconic portrayal for me, at its peak, as I was a kid of the 90s.You can imagine my excitement to finally revisit a darker more gritty low-tech, almost cyberpunk iteration of a dark & early Batman.Here's my honest opinion. This film doesn't live up to its incredible hype riding on its shoulders. It's underwhelming, spotty, and nearly everything is already glimpsed in the trailer. Robert Pattinson made an okay Batman but an awkward bad casting for Bruce Wayne. I gave him a chance but he just didn't fit. Zoe Kravitz on the other hand was the best performance and stole the whole show for me.In my opinion Gotham City has never looked better, the atmosphere is nice, the music is nice. But the story crumbles under a heavy dragging pace that nearly put me and my guest to sleep. It became a chore trying to stay awake. And by the end, it was entirely forgettable and a lackluster one-time-watch.I don't say that with remorse or incredible disappointment. I appreciated the detective-noir aesthetic. I just felt the film was shockingly under-cooked.I came for Zoe Kravitz and she alone made it worth a one-time-watch. But I think this film was too all over the place, lengthy, and shockingly tedious and underwhelming. Won't be watching again, but I can celebrate this small success because I'd still rather take this over the Nolan versions. This just didn't feel like it fit the landing.I was expecting more from the director of Cloverfield, but I can see this must have been a very daunting project to take on.Gotham City and Zoe Kravitz have never looked more beautiful, and she was great in this limited role.",love batman michael keaton batman return set iconic portrayal peak kid imagine excitement finally revisit darker gritty low tech almost cyberpunk iteration dark early batman honest opinion film live incredible hype riding shoulder underwhelming spotty nearly everything already glimpsed trailer robert pattinson made okay batman awkward bad casting bruce wayne gave chance fit zoe kravitz hand best performance stole whole show opinion gotham city never looked better atmosphere nice music nice story crumbles heavy dragging pace nearly put guest sleep became chore trying stay awake end entirely forgettable lackluster one time watch say remorse incredible disappointment appreciated detective noir aesthetic felt film shockingly cooked came zoe kravitz alone made worth one time watch think film place lengthy shockingly tedious underwhelming watching celebrate small success still rather take nolan version feel like fit landing expecting director cloverfield see must daunting project take gotham city zoe kravitz never looked beautiful great limited role,positive,147

"I love Batman and all the trailer was so well made. So, I definitely was hyped for the movie. Watched it on the opening day and the show was houseful, expectedly. But, oh man, this movie just did not do any justice to It's hype. So many loopholes were there. Most the dialogue are so poor. Did not feel any thrill in any fight scene(except only one, which I will not spoil by mentioning). No character were well developed and properly introduced. So, felt no connection with any character. Not even with Batman.What about that mask of the catwoman? Did they have so much budget issue that they couldn't design a proper mask for her? And, the way they made it, what was the purpose of wearing that mask? Also, No proper backstory of her by which we can at least feel connected with her.

Pattinson as Batman it's even worse than Bale(who btw, was so cringy as Batman with that goofy voice and the most overrated Batman ever). For me(i will get so many thumbs down, i don't even care) Ben Affleck was the best Batman/Wayne till date! 4 stars out of 10 for the good music score and for e few action scenes, the majority are just bland and chaotic mess!

"An overrated and overhyped movie and I can't help starting with trivia. Director Matt Reeves had said that he wrote the role of Batman specifically keeping Pattinson in mind and that he would have been disappointed if he didn't do the role. He also mentioned that Pattinson as Batman was required to ""walk stealthily like a ghost"". To those uninitiated into Batman movies and expecting scenes of the superhero to engage in high voltage action , there is disappointment ahead. The movie is a sort of investigative journalism where our caped superhero ( Batman alias Bruce Wayne) is trying to find out the the criminals behind the killing of a few top people ( including Mayor) of the administration of Gotham city. The killer leaves behind clues in the shape of cards for Batman. Additionally Batman has to unearth the facts behind the killing of his father. Batman's transportation is a high powered motorbike on which he does his commuting when he is not driving his Batmobile. Paradoxically for a superhero movie it is slow moving and boring minus the few scenes of action. The cinematography is mostly with ""night effect"", in soft focus, gloomy and depressing with ominous background music. The movie has 175 minutes run time which makes it a difficult, taxing and exhaustive watch. You want to hit the fast forward button. Teenagers who come to this movie expecting Spiderman type of fare may be hugely disappointed. I don't think the director's plan of a ghost walking hero who whispers hoarsely was any good. It is intriguing to say the least. The catwoman ( Zoe Kravitz) is a welcome diversion and she has done well.( At least she speaks clearly and confidently ). Robert Pattinson fits into the director's concept of Batman which is the reason for the type of acting he does. Colin Farrel as Oz has facial makeup of hideous prosthetics. I will leave you with a pun of dark humour the killer leaves behind in a card. "" What does a liar do after he is dead.? Well he lies still.""",overrated overhyped movie help starting trivia director matt reef said wrote role batman specifically keeping pattinson mind would disappointed role also mentioned pattinson batman required walk stealthily like ghost uninitiated batman movie expecting scene superhero engage high voltage action disappointment ahead movie sort investigative journalism caped superhero batman alias bruce wayne trying find criminal behind killing top people including mayor administration gotham city killer leaf behind clue shape card batman additionally batman unearth fact behind killing father batman transportation high powered motorbike commuting driving batmobile paradoxically superhero movie slow moving boring minus scene action cinematography mostly night effect soft focus gloomy depressing ominous background music movie minute run time make difficult taxing exhaustive watch want hit fast forward button teenager come movie expecting spiderman type fare may hugely disappointed think director plan ghost walking hero whisper hoarsely good intriguing say least catwoman zoe kravitz welcome diversion done well least speaks clearly confidently robert pattinson fit director concept batman reason type acting colin farrel oz facial makeup hideous prosthetics leave pun dark humour killer leaf behind card liar dead well lie still,negative,152
"I never thought I'd say this about any Batman movie, but I wish I could get my time back. All the Batman movies starting with the 1989 Batman (Michael Keaton) up until now have been pretty stellar. But, Pattinson's portrayal is absolutely horrible.I fell asleep twice. Pattinson's voice is precisely what did it. No inflection, barely any facial expressions and dronelike. A dark Batman done effectively is Christian Bale under Christopher Nolan's writing and directing. It was dark and emo, and it was done perfectly.This Batman could have been a number of really great actors like Theo James, Steven Strait, Ben Barnes, Bill Skarsgard (he would have crushed it), Max Irons, Josh Bowman or Adam Gregory. The list is literally endless with people that would have been much better in this role.Paul Dano's Riddler was bland as well.On to the good stuff.Zoe Kravitz was a beyond fantastic Selena Kyle. I was already a huge fan before this movie.I didn't even recognize Colin Farrell at first, the makeup was utterly amazing.Nods to the excellency of Peter Sarsgaard, multi-faceted Andy Serkis, the very talented Jeffrey Wright, and the always delightful John Turturro.I gave 4 stars for the spectacular cast (except Pattinson).

Well let me be the first to tell you that much like ""Don't Look Up"", this film simply did not deliver the goods..and I really, REALLY, wanted to love this iteration of our beloved Dark Knight. It's just simply already been done thanks to Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan.

"There are so many Batman movies now. So many styles, so many expectations and standards. The Batman is successful at the outset when it comes to establishing its own style, tone and momentum.It's dark (literally and psychologically), patient, intriguing and draws you in. The look is pretty unique, like a 1940s film noir crossed with gothic architecture from centuries ago, but also with the feel of a modern crime thriller.The Riddler is an interesting villain. Like a serial killer. The clues are exciting since they give us little bits of information and make us want more. We get to see Batman as a detective, a puzzle solver. I became quite excited about where the film would head. With its long running time, my hopes were high.However, it loses steam about halfway through. First of all, the Riddler's motivations suddenly switch. Initially he was targeting corrupt people and exposing the truth. Okay, maybe he's too extreme (killing a torturing) but at least he's hurting bad people. Maybe he will work with Batman! And how far do the lies go? This is becoming big.But then the Riddler kills civilians, seemingly indifferently. And he claims to be inspired by Batman. But Batman only beats up thugs, not random people. And how did Riddler's henchmen know that he calls himself ""vengeance""?It makes no sense for the Riddler to allow himself to get caught. What was the purpose? Okay, it's cute that it was all ""part of the plan"", but why? Think about it and it falls apart.The music. My goodness. It completely sucks. Giacchino cannot write for live action movies. I don't know why. The Incredibles? Great. Up and Inside Out? Very nice. But The Batman? Just, utter crap. Boring, plodding, repetitive, by-the-numbers. Especially compared to the work of Zimmer and Elfman, it's terrible. And it ruins many moments which could have been quite good.Catwoman has some awful lines. References to ""white privilege"" (why was race relevant?) and ""CEO hedge fund types"". What's wrong with CEOs? They help manage massive corporations which sustain thousands of jobs and satisfy millions of customers. If it's so easy, why doesn't she do it? As for hedge funds, many middle class people have money indirectly invested in them. It's simply a mechanism for managing risks in a large, complicated economy. There are wins and losses, but no stealing. They help accommodate entrepreneurs by spreading risks. But who cares about that when you can just hate ""the rich""?Matt Reeves really misses the mark in terms of his overall message. The start works because it's brooding and shows Batman successfully intimidating bad guys. They even fear the shadows - how great is that! But later he implies that Bruce should be doing more for charity, that beating up thugs doesn't work. Why? Because the script says so and Reeves' politics say so.We start getting long, unnecessary shots of Batman walking. The movie drags on. The Riddler is no longer interesting but just some lonely killer with no real plan or insight. He's a loser. The Joker has a lame and unnecessary cameo. The final shot is horrible as Catwoman drives away - but who cares? The connection with Batman feels artificial and her leaving carries no weight.Farrell is good as Penguin, but unrecognisable. In the end though, his character doesn't really change the path of the movie much at all. It's exciting at first, but pointless once you think about it.Batman should have died 3 or 4 times at least, from explosions, falling, getting shot, etc. There are no stakes - he's immortal, along with Alfred and the mayor. What's the point if nobody can die? Is everyone using rubber bullets or something?Nolan's trilogy remains the benchmark for Batman and superhero movies in general.

As I walked out, I had 4/10 in mind but that may change as I think about the movie a bit.Don't expect to see the Batman that you have come to know. In the new movie you are in essence just watching a guy wearing a mask trying to solve a politically and corruption motivated murder. The plot could just as well have been in a Jack Reacher or Ethan Hunt movie. The Batmobile is a suped up Corvette, there is no Bat Cave and he spends most of his time on a motorcycle. His gear is a leather mask, a cape and a torso shaped bullet proof vest. He rounds the costume off with some combat boots.Pattinson is truly uninspiring - rivalling the worst of Seagal's performances. While the cinematography is great, the movie is utterly one trick and monotonous. You are literally sitting for 3 hours listening to eery orchestral tunes and looking at Pattinson staring into the distance while doing his best impression of an emo teenager.There are some strong performances from Kravitz, Farrell and Dano but it is not enough to save the overly long movie.Bring back the Batman from The Dark Night please.

"This might be the Darkest Knight yet. And while it is different, all the shoe-gazing does weigh the movie down.Every character is intentionally one-dimensional, lacking any sense of duality. It has to be this way for the overall theme of comparing the origins and motivations of Riddler and Batman. But again, it is so heavy-handed and dire, is it all that much of a revelation?The whole ""we're not all that different, you and I"" thing has been played out in the age-old ambiguous line between heroes and villains.While Pattinson's Bruce Wayne is hopped up on The Cure and Morrissey, grumbling around every scene, Dano's Riddler is a nice little mystery when in his mask. Less convincing out of it. But still, he is by far the most interesting character in the film.Zoe Kravitz is just not exuding the Feline Fatale like previous portrayers. Best things I can mention is that she is there, saying lines and moving around scenes.Colin Farrell doing De Niro doing Al Capone doing Al Pacino's Pruneface doing the Penguin did very little for me.The car was cool. Nice to see them go American Muscle this time around.And the ""big ending"" with the sea wall flood and the Riddler's followers seemed out of place, rushed and meaningless. The Riddler is supposed to be a lone enigmatic figure. The Joker has disciples. The Riddler inspiring a bunch of internet fanatics to get dressed up as him and wage his vengeful ramblings seemed tacked-on and out of place.Moreover, his ultimate plan is to flood the lower depths of the city, when the rich and powerful and corrupt that he is railing against all live in ivory towers. That made little sense and, again, seems like a set piece for the sake of climactic spectacle.The movie has atmosphere, for sure. A crushingly bleak atmosphere. There is little balance to it.

"I'm not a fan of movies inspired by comics. The Marvel universe and the other parallel imaginary universes do not overwhelm or concern me. I use to judge movies as they are, and I believe that any cinematic genre provides opportunities to tell interesting stories, build characters that one can identify with or that one can energetically dislike, can raise or touch on universal human themes and, most importantly, can provide quality entertainment. That's right, this happened to me less often with comics-inspired movies. I can count on the fingers of one hand the ones I remember with pleasure, and I still have one finger left free: Todd Philips' 'Joker' before any other, the original 'Superman', 'Spider-man' edition 2002 and 'The Dark Knight'. 'The Batman' (2022) directed by Matt Reeves is a gloomy and complicated version of the complex intrigues of the metropolis of Gotham, but it fails to complete my gallery of exceptions and make the last finger useful.I'm not even sure that Batman in the version proposed by this movie is a superhero. The only time in the movie when he flies, he does it only as a last resort, after obvious hesitations, and the aerial promenade ends almost catastrophically, with an emergency landing. His identity is known to almost everyone, of course to the audience, but as long as he plays his role, he doesn't take off his mask even when he kisses, that's how it goes in comics. His nemesis is The Riddler, a vigilante who uses serial killer methods, and for a long time we are in a situation of ambiguity, because from a moral point of view at least, the two seem to be on the same side of Good (or Evil) . The script proposes a complicated detective intrigue, sprinkled with riddles that the assassin leaves at the scenes of his crimes, addressed especially to Batman. Catwoman also shows up, with a parallel personal story of her own. The two, along with Police Commissioner Gordon, will fight alone against a corrupt system complicit with the underground world of crime.As many similar movies, 'The Batman' deserves praise for the visual concept. We are in a dark universe, where it seems to rain almost permanently, excepting when the dams break and the city is completely flooded. At no time do we have a feeling of warmth or light, more than 95% of the action takes place at night and the darkness dominates, figuratively and literally. The story is too long. Movies that last more than two hours need good justification for their duration, that doesn't exist here, and this film lasts almost three hours. The detective action is not interesting enough, the revelations of the characters behind the masks do not bring extraordinary or unexpected surprises, and the successive passes through cinematic genres (police intrigue, vengeance, catastrophe) is done without elegance. The romantic story is fragile to the point of non-existence. Robert Pattinson, whom I have appreciated a lot in other movies, fails to bring the character behind the mask to life, while Zoë Kravitz fails to make us forget other famous actresses who wore the Catwoman's costume. A more interesting role, in the category of 'actors-made-up-beyond-recognition', is played by Colin Farrell. Delicious but too little. 'The Batman' is one of those movies that I can only recommend to fans of comics-inspired movies and especially to those who love the Batman series and do not want to lose any production in the collection.",fan movie inspired comic marvel universe parallel imaginary universe overwhelm concern use judge movie believe cinematic genre provides opportunity tell interesting story build character one identify one energetically dislike raise touch universal human theme importantly provide quality entertainment right happened le often comic inspired movie count finger one hand one remember pleasure still one finger left free todd philip joker original superman spider man edition dark knight batman directed matt reef gloomy complicated version complex intrigue metropolis gotham fails complete gallery exception make last finger useful even sure batman version proposed movie superhero time movie fly last resort obvious hesitation aerial promenade end almost catastrophically emergency landing identity known almost everyone course audience long play role take mask even kiss go comic nemesis riddler vigilante us serial killer method long time situation ambiguity moral point view least two seem side good evil script proposes complicated detective intrigue sprinkled riddle assassin leaf scene crime addressed especially batman catwoman also show parallel personal story two along police commissioner gordon fight alone corrupt system complicit underground world crime many similar movie batman deserves praise visual concept dark universe seems rain almost permanently excepting dam break city completely flooded time feeling warmth light action take place night darkness dominates figuratively literally story long movie last two hour need good justification duration exist film last almost three hour detective action interesting enough revelation character behind mask bring extraordinary unexpected surprise successive pass cinematic genre police intrigue vengeance catastrophe done without elegance romantic story fragile point non existence robert pattinson appreciated lot movie fails bring character behind mask life zo kravitz fails make u forget famous actress wore catwoman costume interesting role category actor made beyond recognition played colin farrell delicious little batman one movie recommend fan comic inspired movie especially love batman series want lose production collection,positive,178

"10/10 for unoriginality. Did we really need another Batman film? Shows how starved Hollywood's for fresh ideas. My five cents worth: cinematically, everything Batman's been said and done; we had the Batman films from 1989 and 1992 (directed by Tim burton). 1992's Batman Returns had Selina Kyle/Catwoman played by Michelle Pfeiffer and it had Penguin played by Danny De Vito. Then in 1995 we got Batman Forever (directed by Joel Schumacher) with Jim Carrey playing The Riddler; if this latest film; The Batman portrayed some villian or character that we hadn't seen before, then maybe it would've been justified. But Penguin, Catwoman and Riddler have been done on screen before. And done better: Michelle Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Danny De Vito's Penguin and Jim Carrey's Riddler from the 1990's films were ten times more interesting and cinematic than the said characters in The Batman. Then in 1997 we got a fourth entry: Batman and Robin. Then in 2005 we got Christopher Nolan's return to a more serious tone with: Batman Begins, followed by The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). So did we need another Batman film? No, we didn't.",unoriginality really need another batman film show starved hollywood fresh idea five cent worth cinematically everything batman said done batman film directed tim burton batman return selina kyle catwoman played michelle pfeiffer penguin played danny de vito got batman forever directed joel schumacher jim carrey playing riddler latest film batman portrayed villian character seen maybe would justified penguin catwoman riddler done screen done better michelle pfeiffer selina kyle catwoman danny de vito penguin jim carrey riddler film ten time interesting cinematic said character batman got fourth entry batman robin got christopher nolan return serious tone batman begin followed dark knight dark knight rise need another batman film,positive,185

"I'm going to break down my review into the good, the bad and the useless.The Good:
Gotham City. It's always a character in Batman. A living, breathing entity that sucks all light in and is a dangerous place.Batman himself. This is Batman. Angry. Full of hatred for criminals. He loves his city. (Batman will also show up in the bad).Commissioner Gordon. Why I can't see why after 80 years, Jim had to be black-I've never heard anyone complain about him being white ever, who doesn't like Jeffery Wright? He's never given a bad performance, and this continues here. He's a fine Jim Gordon. (And I'm glad they kept the mustache, which is almost a character itself when it comes to Gordon)
Alfred-No one, from the TV show to today, has ever been bad as Alfred. While my favorite is Michael Caine, Michael Gough and Andy Serkis (along with Efram Zimbalist from the excellent cartoon), have all been great Alfreds). Alfred is totally important to the mythos of Batman.Penguin. Colin was great, although I could have done without him mimicking Robert DeNiro. He was unrecognizable under a trememndous makeup job, but a little more comic like would have been nice. Danny DeVito is still the best Penguin (with Burgess Meredith and Paul Williams a tie for second).The Bad:
Waaaaay too long.Waaaaay too slow.I like Robert Pattinson as an actor, but he was waaaay too skinny for Batman. He looked like Christian Bales Batman could break him in half. That shirtless scene was embarrassing. (Check out WAR ON CRIME for how Batman/Bruce Waynes torso should look. Or Batman Year One and Year Two). Guy couldn't hit the gym a bit? Between the cosplay costume and his being so skinny, my least favorite Batman.Catwoman. OK, again, after 80 years they had to make her biracial. I get it. This isn't traditional batman. But what do all the previous Catwomen have in common? They're usually tall, slinky, with an air of danger women. My personal favorites are: Julie Newmar, Anne Hathaway and, honorable mention, Michelle Pfieffer (who came across as really dangerous in Batman Returns). Zoe Kravitz is a shrimp and simply just comes across as a wanna be thug. Really terrible casting here.The Story: Really, this is just a Seven/Saw/Superhero mashup. It's too long, too slow and really could have used some light!Too dark! I know Batman is a creature of the night, but hey, we, the audience need to SEE THE MOVIE.When did Gotham become Portland or Seattle? What was with all the rain? Trying to hide how skinny Batman was?Bruce Wayne. Come on. Bruce, like it or not is a character in this! So what the hell is going on here? An Emo, wimpy Bruce Wayne? At least the director gave him an action scene in the church.The Ugly
The Riddler. What a lame, generic costume! It looks like the director originally wanted to do Hush and changed his mind. I wasn't expecting that crazy Jim Carrey costume from one of Schumacher's terrible movies, but something better than this. Want to see how to do the Riddler? Watch Gotham. That's the way to do Riddler.The story. This really could have been way better with a few tweaks. One, cut an hour out of the runtime. No superhero movie needs to be 3 hours. I still haven't rewatched Endgame because, like this-way too long!So, in the end, I gave this 4 stars. That's simply about right. DC needs to either stop attempting to create a unified universe, just do all stand alone movies (they're never topping the Nolan Trilogy, ever.) or get someone like Kevin Feige (I'd recommend Paul Dini, Bruce Timm or Geoff Johns). Get their stuff in one sock and let this guy be the main producer. Also simply tell the fans that the Synderverse (which is) is dead and its time to move on. Get someone in charge who loves the characters (certainly not J. J. Abrams, one of the most overrated filmmakers in history) and go from there. It'll be a pity to lose Gal Gadot, but shes already said she's leaving the character after WW3. And the guy playing Flash? Terrible choice. And doing Flashpoint this early? No run up to it? Just shows why DC needs a unified mind behind the DCverse.As for this: I've seen it and don't think I need to see it again.",going break review good bad useless good gotham city always character batman living breathing entity suck light dangerous place batman batman angry full hatred criminal love city batman also show bad commissioner gordon see year jim black never heard anyone complain white ever like jeffery wright never given bad performance continues fine jim gordon glad kept mustache almost character come gordon alfred one tv show today ever bad alfred favorite michael caine michael gough andy serkis along efram zimbalist excellent cartoon great alfred alfred totally important mythos batman penguin colin great although could done without mimicking robert deniro unrecognizable trememndous makeup job little comic like would nice danny devito still best penguin burgess meredith paul williams tie second bad waaaaay long waaaaay slow like robert pattinson actor waaaay skinny batman looked like christian bale batman could break half shirtless scene embarrassing check war crime batman bruce wayne torso look batman year one year two guy hit gym bit cosplay costume skinny least favorite batman catwoman ok year make biracial get traditional batman previous catwomen common usually tall slinky air danger woman personal favorite julie newmar anne hathaway honorable mention michelle pfieffer came across really dangerous batman return zoe kravitz shrimp simply come across wanna thug really terrible casting story really seven saw superhero mashup long slow really could used light dark know batman creature night hey audience need see movie gotham become portland seattle rain trying hide skinny batman bruce wayne come bruce like character hell going emo wimpy bruce wayne least director gave action scene church ugly riddler lame generic costume look like director originally wanted hush changed mind expecting crazy jim carrey costume one schumacher terrible movie something better want see riddler watch gotham way riddler story really could way better tweak one cut hour runtime superhero movie need hour still rewatched endgame like way long end gave star simply right dc need either stop attempting create unified universe stand alone movie never topping nolan trilogy ever get someone like kevin feige recommend paul dini bruce timm geoff john get stuff one sock let guy main producer also simply tell fan synderverse dead time move get someone charge love character certainly j j abrams one overrated filmmaker history go pity lose gal gadot shes already said leaving character ww guy playing flash terrible choice flashpoint early run show dc need unified mind behind dcverse seen think need see,negative,187
"It's the first major Batman movie in 10 years. What has changed? For starters, Robert Pattinson is the best Batman since Christian Bale, perhaps even better! Matt Reeves builds on what Nolan established before, and amps up the darkness and grit. Colin Farrell appears utterly unrecognizable as a mobbed-up Penguin. Paul Dano is chilling to the bone as The Riddler, who is revamped as a realistic psychopathic mashup of Jigsaw and the Zodiac killer. Zoe Kravitz is cast perfectly as Catwoman. The Batman offers a lot of really cool things, but doesn't add anything new to the franchise. It's a standard cop drama, with Batman. I was expecting a game-changer, and maybe I shouldn't have been. Fans of the lore will be throughly satisfied.",first major batman movie year changed starter robert pattinson best batman since christian bale perhaps even better matt reef build nolan established amp darkness grit colin farrell appears utterly unrecognizable mobbed penguin paul dano chilling bone riddler revamped realistic psychopathic mashup jigsaw zodiac killer zoe kravitz cast perfectly catwoman batman offer lot really cool thing add anything new franchise standard cop drama batman expecting game changer maybe fan lore throughly satisfied,positive,188

"Good detective-based Batman movie, sort of feels like a spiritual successor to Batman: The Animated Series (maybe my favorite Batman version produced by Hollywood). Performances are very good, although the characters often speak in hushed tones for no apparent reason. The camera work is a bit chaotic and messy, but the film noir stylization is effective.The score by Michael Giacchino is excellent, very moody and beautiful. The production design is gorgeous--this is a very visually striking Gotham, and it hearkens back to Tim Burton's Gotham rather than Christopher Nolan's more realistic Chicago-esque Gotham. It tends to be a very impressive movie to watch from a visual standpoint.The opening hour of the movie is excellent, but unfortunately it cannot sustain that level of quality. The story is the weakest part, a meandering focus without a real purpose for the ""detective"" Batman. It's answered very early on who is committing the crimes (the Riddler), and unfortunately Paul Dano's take on the Riddler here doesn't do much. There are other villains too, most notably Colin Farrell's Oz/Penguin, who is a better villain and gives a better performance. Farrell is unrecognizable under the prosthetics and makeup, but he nearly steals the movie.Compared to Christopher Nolan's trilogy, all three of which had strong villainous presences, this one's villain is mostly seen in video. It mutes the impact of threat faced to Batman. And at nearly 3 hours, there isn't enough to support the length. It could have been chopped down 20-30 minutes and not lost anything. Tighter editing would have made this better.Zoe Kravitz is excellent as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, and her presence elevates the movie every time she's in it. And while Robert Pattinson makes for a very good Batman, he's not so much a Bruce Wayne. Jeffrey Wright and Andy Serkis are both good in their supporting roles, particularly Wright who makes for a sympathetic James Gordon.I really feel like this should have gone for an R rating, which would have given the storytellers more room to play with this darker noir-infused Batman. And the length is a hindrance in that it is both too long for this unfocused story, but also too short for what it needed to properly build it out.

"Movie heavily borrowed themes from both the Crow and Seven. This may have worked in a rated R setting, but it definitely does not within a PG-13 world. I would've knocked it anyways for borrowing from such superior films.Pattison was a decent Batman, but writing was a little bit weak. That didn't serve him very well. The problem with a grounded movie with a Riddler is that your script has to be sharp and intelligent to pull it off. This movie did not do that.One of the best versions of Catwoman I've seen.

"So hear me out, I think the Batman has all the ingredients to be a great piece of art in itself. The only missing link, the final touch is the actors and the roles they are assigned with. I think the performers are severely misscast here, all they had to do but failed at was to swap the main actors. I think Paul Dano should've been the Batman (with the glasses of course), the great John Turturro as catwoman, Robert Pattinson as Falcone (preferably with his hair colour from Good Time), Andy Serkis would've worked great as Lt. Gordon, with bonus points if they were bold enough to cast an ape/Gollum version of Serkis, not the regular one, Zoe Kravitz as Penguin (but keep those boots por favor), Collin Farrel makes a wonderful Alfred with his glorious Irish accent, and finally Jeffrey Wright as the Riddler. This arrangement and positioning of avtors would have made a great film in my humble opinion. In the current form, not so much!Okay enough with the jokes, but to be serious how many more batman films do we need? One? Two? Ten? Fifty? Eight freaking billion? How many more times are we sitting through the same story, same characters, same city and same bloody everything? What does this film that the Nolan thrilogy didn't? Now imagine this, imagine having a Lord of the Rings installment every other year, the story remains the same, Frodo and company against the forces of darkness but we get a lot of different versions of Aragorns and Gandalfs (or would they be that different?). Now that would be cool right? No it wouldn't. It would get maddeningly boring and tiresome. It would strip the Tolkein masterpiece of its originality and ruin its well-earned legacy.Alright down with the ranting, I think I found the final solution for this franchise. For the next reboot (which we know is bound to happen) I think they should just cast Danny DeVito as Bruce Wayne, he is already familliar with the Gotham universe and his Italian accent would give him a real aura of a saint, poised to save the city of such loathsome corruption. Honsetly I think it would work wonders.Sorry about that part, I'm just sitting here trying my best to review this film but for some reason all that comes up to my mind is memes and jokes.Sorry not sorry, enough is enough.",hear think batman ingredient great piece art missing link final touch actor role assigned think performer severely misscast failed swap main actor think paul dano batman glass course great john turturro catwoman robert pattinson falcone preferably hair colour good time andy serkis would worked great lt gordon bonus point bold enough cast ape gollum version serkis regular one zoe kravitz penguin keep boot por favor collin farrel make wonderful alfred glorious irish accent finally jeffrey wright riddler arrangement positioning avtors would made great film humble opinion current form much okay enough joke serious many batman film need one two ten fifty eight freaking billion many time sitting story character city bloody everything film nolan thrilogy imagine imagine lord ring installment every year story remains frodo company force darkness get lot different version aragorns gandalfs would different would cool right would get maddeningly boring tiresome would strip tolkein masterpiece originality ruin well earned legacy alright ranting think found final solution franchise next reboot know bound happen think cast danny devito bruce wayne already familliar gotham universe italian accent would give real aura saint poised save city loathsome corruption honsetly think would work wonder sorry part sitting trying best review film reason come mind meme joke sorry sorry enough enough,positive,198

I urge everyone who is contemplating whether to use their $15 to pay for tickets to save their money and just buy The Dark Knight instead. The Dark Knight is a cinematic masterpiece that blows this trash out of the water. This doesn't deserve to even have the title of ""The Batman"" and honestly I would definitely be open to trying to get it permanently changed.

Meaningless finaleWas expecting a lot from this one and the first ten minutes were promising! Loved the whole Gotham vibe. Robert Pattinson was great as always. Andy Serkis' Alfred was mediocre at best. Almost fell asleep in that hospital scene. Paul Dano's Riddler felt a bit half baked and just like any other psycho criminal. The Penguin played by an unrecognisable Colin Farrell did full justice to the character. John Turturro, Geoffrey Wright, Zoë Kravitz all played their parts beautifully. The Falcone plot overall was more interesting and could've taken centre stage had they explored it more. Would've made for a tighter, shorter film that would've been true to the detective genre instead of the bloated three hour saga with the obligatory beat 'em up climax.The thought behind the film and the world created was interesting but it ultimately was detective-ing in the wrong places and wasn't interesting enough.

"Always been a ""Batman"" fan as the D. C. legend is my favorite superhero and watching all of the movies from the classic 1989 one, every so often the fans see that the series changes tone and feel as it's rebooted. ""The Batman"" directed by Matt Reeves is a dark take with conflict as ""Batman"" deals with a city underworld of secrets, while serial killings are happening, and the hope and chance for romance struts right in front of him.Gotham has a serial killer on the loose and with each victim found strange puzzle like word clues are left, as ""Batman"" investigates the mystery and things become complex as it's all tied into a world of city officials and underworld crime figures are connected to them. Plus secrets come up as ""Batman"" himself is wrapped up into this wicked game.The film chemistry and cast of characters are top notch with young star Robert Pattinson filling out the bat suit just fine and Zoe Kravitz is raw and outspoken as Selina Kyle a slash friend and foe love interest of the bat.

"Out of the deep dark depths of Gotham City comes the newest addition to one of the best-known franchises. The Batman, starring Robert Pattinson is thrilling, chilling, and jam-packed with action. We all know and love Batman, but this stellar cast will show you a deeper, darker side of him and other characters who have been loved, and hated, for generations.The Batman is an exciting addition to the DC Universe, but does not follow the original Dark Knight trilogy. This new film follows beloved hero, Batman, as he tracks down a series of murders of Gotham's most powerful people. He is given clues written in cryptic codes that he has to decipher, all while the deviously smart (and insane) Riddler (Paul Dano) is killing off important people one by one. From a history of lies, in a corrupt city, and in a battle over the true meaning of justice comes the new DC film that will get in your mind and stay there.From the moment the lights of the theater dimmed and the movie started, I was hooked. I have never been a fan of movies that waste time getting to the meat of the story, and The Batman wastes no time. This film is full of suspense, and the music is one of the major components that contributes to that. In intense situations, atmosphere is everything, and the music by Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino creates the perfect amount of eeriness and tension. Robert Pattinson's acting is also incredible. This Batman speaks very little, but his body language and facial expressions speak volumes. I was extremely impressed by how real and broken Pattison makes his character seem, and I have never seen this protagonist reach depths like this in other Batman stories. The one thing in this movie I would have liked to see more of is the story behind Batman's technology. He seems to have a million gadgets, but the audience doesn't know exactly what they are or where they came from.The message of this film is that vengeance won't change the past, but helping others can change the future. A big part of this film is about justice and what that means. In the end, we see that justice isn't about killing or hurting others. Justice is about taking what is wrong and fixing it by doing the right thing. Justice does not equal bloody revenge.I give The Batman 5 out of 5 stars, and I recommend it to ages 13 to 17, plus adults. You can see The Batman in theatres on March 4, 2022.

"The whole idea is good but too many mediocre problems:1) music: always the same depressed theme which introduce the batman scene;2) storytelling is mediocre. Just for an idea, Batman cares about enemies safety (""no gun"", ""no arms"" ""no kill"" and so on), but he solicits the penguin in a car duel for no reason which causes a mess involving innocents in perils and provoking victims without he cares about them, so, lives of villains are more important than civilian lives; imagine that the main aim of the batman is to save Gotham he contributes to destroy. An apparent contradiction. Another case: the penguin confesses charges but he is left free from the detective; absurd! What's the problem here: the characters act as if they are isolated from the logic about choices and consequences. This condition makes the story absurd contrasting the realism the director wants the batman movie is portrayed forgetting the interacting between causes and effects;3) reliability: many villains easily confess charges, although no consequences;4) dialogues are pathetic: the bad copy of Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. As example: the hospital scene with Alfred is pathetic... he asked him for the truth while his butler was going to die unfeeling about his conditions. Soon after confessing him his major fear which is to lose people he loves. Catwoman and Batman dialogues are mediocre too. It seems that the director has no idea on what those characters have to say each other.5) Bruce figure is stereotyped. I didn't like Pattinson interpretation. His acting is poor. Probably this actor is overhyped;What to save:1) the villain character, his strategy and above all the acting of the actor who plays the riddle. The best;2) the theme: the main aftermath in corruption is iniquity and poverty, from which Vendetta;3) probably, it's the first time a ""villain"", which acts as antihero, prevails getting his aim (the reason why the best Star Wars movie is the V episode. It's not because I like bad ending but because it's more realistic).One note: Falcone is the surname of one of the main heroes who fought against mafia in Italy because of which he was killed... a big mistake to use his surname for a mafia character.",whole idea good many mediocre problem music always depressed theme introduce batman scene storytelling mediocre idea batman care enemy safety gun arm kill solicits penguin car duel reason cause mess involving innocent peril provoking victim without care life villain important civilian life imagine main aim batman save gotham contributes destroy apparent contradiction another case penguin confesses charge left free detective absurd problem character act isolated logic choice consequence condition make story absurd contrasting realism director want batman movie portrayed forgetting interacting cause effect reliability many villain easily confess charge although consequence dialogue pathetic bad copy christopher nolan masterpiece example hospital scene alfred pathetic asked truth butler going die unfeeling condition soon confessing major fear lose people love catwoman batman dialogue mediocre seems director idea character say bruce figure stereotyped like pattinson interpretation acting poor probably actor overhyped save villain character strategy acting actor play riddle best theme main aftermath corruption iniquity poverty vendetta probably first time villain act antihero prevails getting aim reason best star war movie v episode like bad ending realistic one note falcone surname one main hero fought mafia italy killed big mistake use surname mafia character,positive,207
"The iconic character of Bruce Wayne a.k.a. Batman has been brought to the big screen several times: Tim Burton's great ""Batman"" (1989) and ""Batman Returns"" (1992) were a tribute to the comic book style. Then came Christopher Nolan's trilogy with plots more focused on neo-noir and with a darker comic style. This 2022, Matt Reeves launches his vision of the bat, ""The Batman"", with an intriguing script that mixes neo-noir and psychological thriller. The work of the cinematographer is of a higher level, the camera movements are daring and that dark, quite gothic atmosphere is captivating. The soundtrack is incredible, as well as a great job by the sound department. The direction of Matt Reeves is totally successful and the performances are tremendous, Robert Pattinson once again demonstrates his histrionic capacity, but the performances that deserve a standing ovation are those of Zoë Kravitz and Paul Dano.

"First time in my life I left the theater while watching a DC or Marvel movie. I have seen The Dark Knight in IMAX theather when it first came out. It was marvelous, I still remember how it felt to see some of the scenes on IMAX. Therefore I went to see this on IMAX on a huge screen with high quality audio. However, this one adopts traditional filming techniques. No crisp and mind bending visuals here, merely 90s thriller. This could have been easily released on streaming services because you don't need big screen for this. It would make much easier to watch 180 minutes movie.On the other hand I noticed that some people compare this with Se7en but it's nowhere close to it. Here we have a Batman whose IQ is 180 or something. Almost all Riddlar puzzles are being solved in seconds by him. I didn't know Bruce Wayne is known by his detective skills. He's just a rich guy, invests his entire wealth to build high tech gadgets to solve puzzles and beat his enemies. Also this Batman doesn't have that fearful look. He's just a person looks like came out of a Halloween party. No intimidation at all.Clearly director tried to pull off what Joker (2019) did. Create an ordinary character out of flesh and blood instead of a fantasy character. Yes, it beautifully worked with Joker but this is completely different. Especially certain Riddlar scenes were terrible. Actor pushed it too hard to play a psycho. Plus, some of his actions reminded me Heath Ledger's joker. Zoe is beautiful, she's acting alright but this is not Catwoman movie (I prefer Anna Hathaway version with her self-confident persona) , it is called The Batman. What I expect is to see proper character development on Batman before everything. It doesn't matter we all know the story. This is a reboot and we have a new actor in our hand.Long story short, this is just a wannabe movie. I read an article before seeing it. The director said to Nolan that he'll make a better movie than Dark Knight. I knew it was not possible to do it in post-2013 era (Woke), even Nolan cannot do it again. But I had hopes honestly. Movie simply didn't make me attached to any character around 70 minutes mark and I had no intention to see the rest. Because I knew that there was still another 110 minutes ahead of me. Maybe I'll look into it when it comes to streaming services. Yet I don't look forward to it.I must say that 10/10 reviews are either trolls or people haven't seen good movies before (or no movies other than dc/marvel). A movie above 8/10 would suck you in right from the beginning while this one couldn't do it even after an hour.Edit: Finally watched the entire movie. It took 3 days but finished it. I think the main issue here is editing. Movie cannot maintain the excitement, if there is any, and 3 hours duration doesn't help. Such a borefest and third act doesn't change this fact. Actually even in the third act there were certain annoying moments but I don't want to give spoilers. That being said I won't change my score, it's still a 6. However, I must admit that Paul Dano does a fair job with Riddlar even though certain scenes and actions remind me Heath Ledger's Joker.",first time life left theater watching dc marvel movie seen dark knight imax theather first came marvelous still remember felt see scene imax therefore went see imax huge screen high quality audio however one adopts traditional filming technique crisp mind bending visuals merely thriller could easily released streaming service need big screen would make much easier watch minute movie hand noticed people compare se en nowhere close batman whose iq something almost riddlar puzzle solved second know bruce wayne known detective skill rich guy invests entire wealth build high tech gadget solve puzzle beat enemy also batman fearful look person look like came halloween party intimidation clearly director tried pull joker create ordinary character flesh blood instead fantasy character yes beautifully worked joker completely different especially certain riddlar scene terrible actor pushed hard play psycho plus action reminded heath ledger joker zoe beautiful acting alright catwoman movie prefer anna hathaway version self confident persona called batman expect see proper character development batman everything matter know story reboot new actor hand long story short wannabe movie read article seeing director said nolan make better movie dark knight knew possible post era woke even nolan cannot hope honestly movie simply make attached character around minute mark intention see rest knew still another minute ahead maybe look come streaming service yet look forward must say review either troll people seen good movie movie dc marvel movie would suck right beginning one even hour edit finally watched entire movie took day finished think main issue editing movie cannot maintain excitement hour duration help borefest third act change fact actually even third act certain annoying moment want give spoiler said change score still however must admit paul dano fair job riddlar even though certain scene action remind heath ledger joker,positive,210

"'The Batman' gives us 6th film-version of Bruce Wayne in Robert Pattinson and a lot of people are asking ""do we need another Batman film?"" After watching this, the answer is ""yes"". From the director of the last two (great) 'Planet of the Apes' films, this is a brooding and dark, true-to-form Batman film, much closer to Tim Burton's films than the Snyder & Schumacher films. It has some aspects in similar with the Nolan trilogy, but is different enough to stand alone.This is a younger Batman/Bruce, and does well to not re-tell the story of his parents' deaths. Essential to any good Batman film is a good Alfred and Serkis is great. The entire cast is really good - Selina (Kravitz), Lieutenant Gordon (Wright), the Riddler (Dano), Falcone (Turturro) and Oswald/Penguin (Farrell) - who is literally unrecognisable in his make-up. Dano brings a great energy to the Riddler and makes him seem realistic in the world we live in - definitely no trace of Jim Carey here! The scenes with Bruce & Selina work really well.While this is very dark, both visually and thematically - including the repeated use of Nirvana's 'Something in the Way' - it really suits the noir vibe of the mystery that has Bruce & Gordon trying to solve the Riddler's puzzles/murders. They make Gotham very believable - always raining - and there's a great car chase scene, as well as plenty of realistic hand-to-hand combat. While it's long - almost 3 hours - it doesn't drag and the pacing is good, with the non-action components being as exciting as the fight scenes. By the end, I was certainly convinced by the validity of Pattinson, the suit and this film.",batman give u th film version bruce wayne robert pattinson lot people asking need another batman film watching answer yes director last two great planet ape film brooding dark true form batman film much closer tim burton film snyder schumacher film aspect similar nolan trilogy different enough stand alone younger batman bruce well tell story parent death essential good batman film good alfred serkis great entire cast really good selina kravitz lieutenant gordon wright riddler dano falcone turturro oswald penguin farrell literally unrecognisable make dano brings great energy riddler make seem realistic world live definitely trace jim carey scene bruce selina work really well dark visually thematically including repeated use nirvana something way really suit noir vibe mystery bruce gordon trying solve riddler puzzle murder make gotham believable always raining great car chase scene well plenty realistic hand hand combat long almost hour drag pacing good non action component exciting fight scene end certainly convinced validity pattinson suit film,positive,212
"""The Batman"" is as bad as the Schumacher movies. Except instead of being too silly and camp it takes itself way to seriously so much so that it becomes camp. It's almost as if the film makers were having a giggle at 15 year old edge lords who (as Henry Rollins once put it) write black poetry in black rooms using black ink on black paper. Because they are so damn moody.Add to ""edgey"" atmosphere an unneeded 3hr runtime to tell a watered down (no pun intended) version of Hush meets Se7en and you'll probably find yourself struggling to stay awake.The thing is.. I love Batman as a character.. I'm just so so tired of the teen angst version of him.. if I want that I'll watch the Crow... at least that's shorter and has a cool soundtrack.",batman bad schumacher movie except instead silly camp take way seriously much becomes camp almost film maker giggle year old edge lord henry rollins put write black poetry black room using black ink black paper damn moody add edgey atmosphere unneeded hr runtime tell watered pun intended version hush meet se en probably find struggling stay awake thing love batman character tired teen angst version want watch crow least shorter cool soundtrack,negative,213
"I watched it and I was disappointed.I don't get the hype. Are these reviews paid reviews? 8,3 at the moment I am rating it.This is so much inferior to the Nolan trilogy and IMHO I am not that excited about it either.Robert Pattinson is praised about showing his acting skills even though I saw none except the poker face and the crow face(?)
For a reason I do not comprehend, in this movie the Riddler acts like Joker(??)
The movie is boring, uninteresting , not fun to watch, too dark (I mean the light is almost extinct)
The penguin looked as if it was the Italian mafia boss.AND Batman takes the stupidity award of the century. He is being constantly shot at from close proximity. He does nothing to prevent this from happening even though his face is exposed. He stands right next to the man whose bomb is about to explode and takes no cover ,nor he cares about the evacuation process. He gets electrocuted as well.The catwoman was a good fit for the role , maybe the only well-casted actor.And from this movie after watching all Batman movies ever made, I learn that Batman is a detective(?). Where did this come from . He was always a justice vigilante. Not a detective..
I really think that this movie had no point to make whatsoever. It was a needless addition. I personally would like to watch Ben Affleck return as Batman for JL2 (directed by Zac Snyder). That would be a great movie to make. Joker was a great movie and it was kept somehow away from Batman (even though Joker meets young Bruce and of course Bruce's parents are murdered) .Joker was like a perfect origin movie for Joker but without the need to be continued or for Joakin to repraise the role.But this movie was actually nothing. It was a mess of a movie with a Batman acting recklessly and also a reunion of other characters on screen.",watched disappointed get hype review paid review moment rating much inferior nolan trilogy imho excited either robert pattinson praised showing acting skill even though saw none except poker face crow face reason comprehend movie riddler act like joker movie boring uninteresting fun watch dark mean light almost extinct penguin looked italian mafia bos batman take stupidity award century constantly shot close proximity nothing prevent happening even though face exposed stand right next man whose bomb explode take cover care evacuation process get electrocuted well catwoman good fit role maybe well casted actor movie watching batman movie ever made learn batman detective come always justice vigilante detective really think movie point make whatsoever needle addition personally would like watch ben affleck return batman jl directed zac snyder would great movie make joker great movie kept somehow away batman even though joker meet young bruce course bruce parent murdered joker like perfect origin movie joker without need continued joakin repraise role movie actually nothing mess movie batman acting recklessly also reunion character screen,positive,214

"Frankly didn't enjoy this so much, the story is already empty and flat without much twists and intensity, together with the long uninteresting shots of motionless characters makes it even more boring. The dialogues were dull and the acting were stiff and a bit too pretentious. Too little actions and sounds that were just weak and lack of impact, even the last scenes and endings were such a let down, a tiny boring flood that does nothing, together with small goons that were beaten up without much effort. The riddles were just witless without much depth, the bat mobile and bike looks ridiculous like some mockup models from youtubers, the casts weren't even good representations for the characters.

"Another Hollywood cash grab that leaves me cold. Pattinson seems to channeling some emo energy 20 years or so out of date. The whole thing is in need of good lighting and in the end things remain so physically dark that I found it all thoroughly depressing. The idea to stylise this as a film noir I don't really get either, I know the film noir genre well but there's more to it than dark lighting and a detective-style narrative. This one has no atmosphere, just the usual brooding hero and multiple predictable villains. An unrecognisable Farrell is okay, if underutilised, but Dano is plain annoying, and don't get me started on non-actor Kravitz who messes up all her scenes. Worst of all are the fight scenes, which consist of the usual over-choreographed weak sparring that spoils so much mainstream stuff these days.",another hollywood cash grab leaf cold pattinson seems channeling emo energy year date whole thing need good lighting end thing remain physically dark found thoroughly depressing idea stylise film noir really get either know film noir genre well dark lighting detective style narrative one atmosphere usual brooding hero multiple predictable villain unrecognisable farrell okay underutilised dano plain annoying get started non actor kravitz mess scene worst fight scene consist usual choreographed weak sparring spoil much mainstream stuff day,negative,219

"Batman has had lots of movies through the years and he did a bit of detective work, but not much. So this movie obviously wanted to showcase this ability of The Batman and it does so very well having a very good set of villains as this Riddler is much more what I am used to in the comics, the Penguin is not some mutated dude raised by penguins and corruption is the key to everything. We get a new Batman in Robert Pattison and he does a very good job, more dark and brooding and without all the growling and shouting of Bale's. The movie is dark and just very interesting as it truly had me wondering who and what was the endgame. However, there is action, so do not let people try to say that the film is absent of some good old punching!The story, key political figures are being dispatched, first it is the mayor. The person responsible leaves chilling riddles behind and seems to be taking an interest in Batman who is already Batman so no origin story here. Batman is already working with Gordon and looks over the crime scene. Soon things start to point to this person or that and even Bruce's father may have a part in it as the Riddler's game turns out to be even more heinous than even Batman could guess!Pattison was very good as Batman, he was not super muscular like the Batman in the comics, but really the only guy who pumped up for the role was Ben Affleck's Batman. I would put Robert in a tie with Bale in second as they both look fit, but not really jacked up. Colin is great as the Penguin and I was totally surprised to find Andy Serkis was Alfred. I kept thinking I know him from somewhere, but I guess I just did not think of the actor as old enough to be Alfred. Zoe Kravitz is a rather good Catwoman, not quite Michelle's but better than the one from Rising. The Batmobile I rather liked, like the Batmobile fused with Mad Max's vehicle!So, this film was good, I would say it is my fave Batman, but one always tends to fall in love with something when they see it for the first time, so I'll hold judgement. I am very curious to see where this is going and if they team up who I think they are going to team up, that would be really cool. I definitely think Robert can do the job, was not a fan of Twilight, but come on, everyone has to get their start somewhere, and he was so dark in this film, most will forget that he ever sparkled.",batman lot movie year bit detective work much movie obviously wanted showcase ability batman well good set villain riddler much used comic penguin mutated dude raised penguin corruption key everything get new batman robert pattison good job dark brooding without growling shouting bale movie dark interesting truly wondering endgame however action let people try say film absent good old punching story key political figure dispatched first mayor person responsible leaf chilling riddle behind seems taking interest batman already batman origin story batman already working gordon look crime scene soon thing start point person even bruce father may part riddler game turn even heinous even batman could guess pattison good batman super muscular like batman comic really guy pumped role ben affleck batman would put robert tie bale second look fit really jacked colin great penguin totally surprised find andy serkis alfred kept thinking know somewhere guess think actor old enough alfred zoe kravitz rather good catwoman quite michelle better one rising batmobile rather liked like batmobile fused mad max vehicle film good would say fave batman one always tends fall love something see first time hold judgement curious see going team think going team would really cool definitely think robert job fan twilight come everyone get start somewhere dark film forget ever sparkled,positive,221
"When the criminal The Riddler (Paul Dano) executes corrupt politicians and authorities in Gotham City, Batman (Robert Pattinson) and the honest Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) investigate the crime spree without knowing who is trustful. Batman uses the waitress of a notorious club, Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz), to obtain hidden information that affect many prominent people in Gotham City's society and following the riddles of the villain ""The Riddler"".""The Batman"" is an overhyped, too long, melodramatic and boring movie of the hero created in 1939 by Bob Kane. The contemporary writers have created a hero totally different from that we used to read in comics book when we were young. Now Batman has existential crisis, is not funny and is performed by Robert Pattinson, who is a good actor but not for this genre. The plot is also melodramatic developed in slow pace becoming boring during almost three hours running time. The caricatural Penguin from the comics become the mobster Oz. The guy destroys dozens of vehicles, certainly killing people in the explosions, and is not arrested. The only nostalgic moment is when the film turns into a disaster film from the 70's.

"""The Batman"" is not a movie, it's actually just a four-part mini-series that is shown one after the other, in one piece, as a film. Just like ""Dune"" and many other new movies, that are unnecessarily long, tell the story extremely slow and seem to last forever. What's wrong with a 90 minute or at most 2 hour movie? What's wrong with a fast paced movie with lots of action? Why do movies suddenly have to be 3 hours long or more? This makes most movies boring. That goes for ""Dune"", ""Tenet"" and many others and it also goes for this movie ""The Batman""! Had the film been an hour shorter, the simple story could have been told fascinatingly, as it should be in a movie. But now the film drags on like a soap opera, with long-winded shots of stares and boring dialogue that add nothing to it. Even the music, shamelessly borrowed from John Williams, cannot ad any to it. It can still be a good movie, when cut down to 90 minutes. In fact, only the last James Bond movie has managed to captivate the viewer for 3 hours, but all the other more than 2 hour films of recent times all bear the stamp of the HBO, NetFlix, Prime, Apple and Disney series: slowness, to keep the viewer streaming as long as possible, so they don't go to the competitor.

"As a big fan of Robert Pattinson, and as a fan of Batman in general (well, at least the good Batman movies--I LOVE Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy,) I was looking forward to this gritty, mystery-based Batman story. I was hoping that a tone reminiscent of a David Fincher-esque crime thriller would make the film a unique and authentic viewing experience, combined with a hopefully-compelling villain (the Riddler.) Unfortunately, the film did not meet my high expectations. It's certainly not bad, but it leaves more to be desired than one would hope.The film centers on Batman early on in his crime-fighting career, and broadly centers around his attempts to stop the Riddler committing grisly murders of Gotham City elites. The film has some good cinematography and strong production values that elaborately and thoughtfully convey a sense of grit, darkness, and grime in Gotham City. Michael Giacchino's score is also impressive; it is deeply brooding while simultaneously creating a commanding sense of ambition, dread, and atmosphere. Its performances are a bit of a mixed bag. Robert Pattinson is OK as Batman, but his acting style is unfortunately too one-note to most effectively play the part and thus makes his performance a bit underwhelming compared to Christian Bale or even Michael Keaton, for example. ZoÃ« Kravitz does well as Catwoman, providing a more authentic and gritty portrayal of the character than in the past. Paul Dano provides a chilling and eerily realistic portrayal of the Riddler, who can effectively portray the deranged effects of internet radicalization on people. I thought the rest of the cast was generally strong; highlights include Jeffrey Wright as. James Gordon, Collin Farrell as The Penguin, and Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth--although the latter two do not have too much screen time. Yet ""The Batman"" is a film more flawed than I was hoping it would be. First and foremost, the film runs far too long. Unlike the cohesive and superbly well-paced Nolan films, this movie did not need to be 3 hours long, and significant chunks of the second act could have been edited down or made tighter without losing the plot. The pacing can be erratic at times as well, seemingly jumping back and forth between crime thriller, superhero film, and character drama. That may seem like this film tries to be a jack of all trades, but if that was the intention of the writers, they did not succeed. This type of ""serial killer thriller"" has been done much better and more authentically in movies like ""Se7en,"" so even though this film feels that it is being creatively bold by introducing these elements within the constraints of a Batman film, it doesn't manage to do anything new, authentic, or convincing with these elements. The action scenes are mostly forgettable, besides a mid-film Batmobile chase that is fleeting but a ton of fun to watch. Yet what makes the film a mild disappointment is that the stakes involved and attempts at building an emotional core are not done well or integrated fully into the screenplay, making the film seem far less ""whole"" than the best Batman movies.Recommended for theatrical viewing only for big fans of Batman; everyone else can wait to rent or stream it. 6/10.",big fan robert pattinson fan batman general well least good batman movie love christopher nolan dark knight trilogy looking forward gritty mystery based batman story hoping tone reminiscent david fincher esque crime thriller would make film unique authentic viewing experience combined hopefully compelling villain riddler unfortunately film meet high expectation certainly bad leaf desired one would hope film center batman early crime fighting career broadly center around attempt stop riddler committing grisly murder gotham city elite film good cinematography strong production value elaborately thoughtfully convey sense grit darkness grime gotham city michael giacchino score also impressive deeply brooding simultaneously creating commanding sense ambition dread atmosphere performance bit mixed bag robert pattinson ok batman acting style unfortunately one note effectively play part thus make performance bit underwhelming compared christian bale even michael keaton example zo kravitz well catwoman providing authentic gritty portrayal character past paul dano provides chilling eerily realistic portrayal riddler effectively portray deranged effect internet radicalization people thought rest cast generally strong highlight include jeffrey wright james gordon collin farrell penguin andy serkis alfred pennyworth although latter two much screen time yet batman film flawed hoping would first foremost film run far long unlike cohesive superbly well paced nolan film movie need hour long significant chunk second act could edited made tighter without losing plot pacing erratic time well seemingly jumping back forth crime thriller superhero film character drama may seem like film try jack trade intention writer succeed type serial killer thriller done much better authentically movie like se en even though film feel creatively bold introducing element within constraint batman film manage anything new authentic convincing element action scene mostly forgettable besides mid film batmobile chase fleeting ton fun watch yet make film mild disappointment stake involved attempt building emotional core done well integrated fully screenplay making film seem far le whole best batman movie recommended theatrical viewing big fan batman everyone else wait rent stream,positive,233

"If you like se7en + zodiac + true detective then you'll probably like this new batman rendition.I personally didnt really enjoy this 3 hours of dark & nighttime setting. All those black & yellow hue are okay at first but after 90minutes it just gets tedious. Plot wise eeeh its pretty okay if you dont mind convoluted plot and long drawn conclusion. You're gonna feel that almost 3hrs of runtime. It would've sufficed with 2hrs because some shot are just unnecessary and they pan the camera a bit too long, so it adds up. 2hrs would've been better.The question is, is Robert Pattinson a good batman? For me its to soon to tell, I dont mind him as batman. I think there's still room to grow. I do mind however, that he is so brooding, moody and almost emo batman (almost remind me to uh a certain gentleman who also likes the dark & sparkle, almost) at least there's character growth at the very end of movie. Which is why I said he's still got potential to be a better batman.There's so little of alfred and that's a shame.Paul dano as riddler is fine, I just wish he didn't wear a full mask that barely shows his eyes, felt like we missed a good performance. Though we finally saw him without his riddler mask, it just felt like a waste of his performance. Zoe kravitz as catwoman is great, better than her predeccessor Anne hathaway. She's mainly the movie's emotional core in my opinion.Also the theme of gotham being such a corrupt city run by mob, dirty cop & corrupt politician seems like an overdone. They're much better executed in nolan's trilogy and I think it provides such good closure and ending that revisiting this will of course draws unfavorable comparison.Oooohh but what a treat that Barry Keoghan, that laugh, that tease. Certainly perks me up from my seat. Now THAT'S the cherry on top of the long drawn out movies. Alas at the very end I just cannot wait for this to be over.

"The story of this film seemed very simple and unnecessary to develop it in 3 hours.There are elements that do not modify the plot much and that would modify the duration of this story, which although it lasts 3 hours, it does not have a complete development, there are many confusing things that you need to think about several times to make sense, due to the little context that gives us about it. Even though there is a mystery to solve, it doesn't seem like it needs a resolution, plus the antagonist's mission ends up being very superficial and stupid even though it seems to be justifiable at first. I think it's a solid Batman despite not giving us a specific focus on what he is trying to achieve, is also accompanied by a good performance, but the other characters seem flat and some totally caricatured, the dark tone of the film works well but the mystery does not end up convincing me. The action scenes are good and look good, although the car persecution looks a bit ridiculous, the CGI looks very fake, especially in the last scenes, although the practical effects look good, when there are panoramic shots of the city from Gotham, these make the city shine, the performances are generally good, the music is good.I think it was not necessary for the story to be told in three hours since most of what happened does not have a great impact on the plot, but the technical aspects make it not entirely forgettable, especially because of the action scenes, a car crash scene at the beginning and for the compromised performances despite not having a good character development, its biggest flaw is a very weak script despite the well-done technical aspects, maybe it works once but I don't think it will a movie that you can watch many times in a row.",story film seemed simple unnecessary develop hour element modify plot much would modify duration story although last hour complete development many confusing thing need think several time make sense due little context give u even though mystery solve seem like need resolution plus antagonist mission end superficial stupid even though seems justifiable first think solid batman despite giving u specific focus trying achieve also accompanied good performance character seem flat totally caricatured dark tone film work well mystery end convincing action scene good look good although car persecution look bit ridiculous cgi look fake especially last scene although practical effect look good panoramic shot city gotham make city shine performance generally good music good think necessary story told three hour since happened great impact plot technical aspect make entirely forgettable especially action scene car crash scene beginning compromised performance despite good character development biggest flaw weak script despite well done technical aspect maybe work think movie watch many time row,positive,243
"What were they thinking? Now let me just say that the story isn't bad, it's just the way they do it. Like this wasn't a three hour story but they turned it into that with lingering shots that didn't go anywhere and a very slow walking Batman. Why was he so slow? Keaton walked but Pattinson moves Michael Myers slow. Even when he picked up things he moved slow. Like it was hard to move that slow. Why? The car chase for example had next to nothing happen and it was like 5 minutes. Why all these shots of their faces? And when the Batmobile first appears and everyone is staring at it for a full minute and then it stalls out? Was that susposed to be funny?Let me say that I am a huge Batman fan. Movies and comics. I know them all. I am not one of those comic fans that are afraid of change. Movies and comics are different. I welcome any change in Batman because it's been around 80 years, you gotta switch it up. Even if I don't like a change I don't think it's dumb and I'm glad they tried to do something different.I was excited when they announced Pattinson. I knew he was really good but thought he would be stuck as Edward. Glad to see he isn't. But he wasn't a good Batman. He just didn't fit the part very well. Acting wise he was good, he did what he was supposed to but he just didn't fit it. He's too small, isn't threatening and he doesn't have the voice. He just whispers the whole movie to try and get the voice. Along with almost everybody else. And isn't the point of Bruce Wayne to not act like Batman so people don't make the connection? And when his black hair is in his face and you can only see his mouth it's all the more obvious. I get that psychologically he'd be messed up but to act like this all the time? To wear sunglasses inside? The director must have thought that was so cool.I was excited by the idea of detective Batman because in the comics that's what he is. And the movies haven't really done it yet. But that's okay, movies are different. Big car chases don't really come across in comics so work to the mediums strength. But, they screwed it up. Instead of a gripping suspense story we got a slow, uninteresting one. You know because Batman wasn't solving anything, he just knew it already. One glance and he knew it. He didn't even have to think about those riddles. Val Kilmer had to think for a second. It was the most like the comics out of all the movies. I don't know if this proved that this isn't a good thing or if this movie just sucked. And it's like the comics also in the sense that most of the comics aren't that great.The Riddler was so annoying. His acting was all over the place. Jim Carey must have been watching this saying, tone it down. He wasn't bad because his take on the Riddler, it was just a bad character. So annoying with his voice all over the place. And if they wanted him to be like the Joker then why didn't they just do the Joker?Catwoman was good. As was her relationship with Bats. But her mask? If you can call it that. It doesn't conceal her face at all! Did Zoe not want to hide her perfect model face, or did they think this looked cool? Gordon was good. Penguin was good. They finally did it right and just made him an ugly gangster.Why didn't Batman have any kind of story? There was nothing to do with his character. Nothing! And the whole Thomas Wayne thing didn't need to be there. Take that out and it's the same movie, except shorter.The ending of flooding Gotham? Yeah, that wasn't added by the studio later. That whole end didn't fit the movie at all. The climax was Batman almost beating that guy to death? Or something? There were so many moments that were meant to mean something but didn't. And people thought that Bane doing what he did to Gotham was too much but this is okay?The fights scenes weren't even cool! They got old really fast. His hard punches were cool at first but then it got old. And Batman just knocking on the door? Then walking around casually? I was like, oh okay I guess he doesn't sneak around and randomly pop up like a serial killer. But then he started to! You can't have it both ways! Either he's realistic or he isn't!Did Batman and Riddler have the same tailor? Their nose pieces were exactly the same! And Batman's wrist arrows? He didn't use those once! Once! And one Bat a rang on his chest? I guess that kinda sums up this whole movie: contrived. They just tried too hard on everything. Their thinking, ""So in every Batman movie he uses batarangs. So we won't. In every movie his nose is pointy. So we'll have it be soft ""I am Vengeance? What was up with that? Was that his name? This is part of a really cool line from The Animated Series. What did that mean? I guess that kinda sums up the derivative natural of this movie. They saw things from other movies and put it into theirs without understanding it's meaning. Does he saunter up to every thug and say, ""I'm Vengeance?"" What is he avenging? There was nothing about Bruce or why he does anything! 89 gave you the smallest amount of information to make you understand Batman and it worked!It felt like they were trying really hard to not be like any of the other movies but then did so many things like the other movies. There were so many scenes taken directly from other Batman movies. I don't want to get into them, my legs are falling asleep. I had to watch the fight scene from BVS where Batman fights all the thugs to wipe this crap clean. I went and watched Begins a few days later to get a real Batman movie. And it seems like Reeves watched that and was thinking, ""Okay, they did this we're going to do the opposite. Batman jumps down the staircase, we'll have him go up it. Batman appears out of nowhere, we'll have him walk right up. The batmobile starts up from the shadows and shoots forward right away, we'll have it take forever and not work. Nolan made a good movie, we'll make a bad one."" There were way more things but it seemed obvious that this was the thinking and why this movie sucked. Begins does a lot of things that 89 does but it doesn't feel like a rip off because they're Batman things.I think the biggest problem is that they were trying to make a realistic Batman. But The Dark Knight Trilogy just did that and they did it about as good and you could. So this movie only had one place to go: Darker and grittier. They forgot one thing that Nolan did though: make a good movie. Begins told an origin story that no one had done before and it made sense. 89 told you enough for it to make sense. This did nothing.

"So Patterson as Batman... I wasn't exactly concerned. But the news, that. He refused to work out (and buff up) - was more a bummer...But hey.- Reeves is a good Director and they will make a great movie...A good movie it is. But it wasn't (at all) a Batman movie. It would have been probably infinitely better, if Reeves would have made the movie from the Riddler perspective. In fact, it sounds like a fantastic idea, to make a movie which is from the ""Batman prey"" perspective. A lot of criticism I have might have disappeared...Anyway lets just talk about the great stuff: the cinematography is fantastic. Everything is cut perfectly, the color gamut is broody and great, the costumes (maybe except of the Batsuit?), the scenery. All has been done fantastic.Even better was the Riddler. I must say, I haven't been especially impressed with his ""costume"". It works, but there is no real context. But overall the Riddler is fantastic - and at a certain scene he is for sure dominating a scene with Batman. Absolutely great.Oh - the Penguin as crime bossling. Great stuff. Colin Ferrel really hit hart with his portrayal. It is one of the roles, which were absolutely mesmerizing, because it was not Colin.. it was the Penguin. Probably next to ""Les Grossman"" (Tom Cruise) in Tropic Thunder, one of the best conformations.Zoey Kravitz has been also fantastic. Not a typical role as Catwoman - a far more grounded version. She is sexy without being over the top. Strong without being unrealistic. Great stuff.Felix Leiter - sorry Commissioner Gordon is also great. Maybe for few minutes a bit awkward but overall fantastic.And even Patterson was good. A bit emo - but in some scenes he really could really show the pain he endured due to the death of his parents. Maybe in this moments, he would be better than any other Bruce Wayne before.The story - it is not another amajgeddon - it is ""just a believable"" terror attack by a psychopath. This is also believable for me.So why only 6/10?Let's start with the last point: I had the feeling, that the story was a bit too much borrowed of the Zodiac Killer mixed with Saw. Lacked a bit originality.Also: Batman supposed to be the ""best detective"" here. But really he isn't. The scene which I have talked about above: Where Riddler confronted Batman, that he overestimated him? I had exactly the same feeling. It seemed that Batman was pretty good in solving ""riddles"" - but not really a good detective at all. He exactly followed the path what Riddle laid out for him.Another thing: strength, weaknesses, power-scaling - lets face it: the Patterson Batman would be already dead: there is no particular gadgets (...) of his suit, which can explain, why dominates. He also doesn't show a particular fighting style, strength or craftiness when fighting. He is also not smart when interacting with his environment... what do I mean? The Bale Batman had gadgets and Ninja training. The Affleck Batman was more brawn - but had also gadgets and used the element of surprise (sans the ninja). Even the Keaton Batman had the same combination of surprise and gadgets.Patterson is walking into the scene. It is just not believable. Especially as he is just a twig. This apex' in the scene, where he is affected by Riddlers bomb!The Batmobile is equally nonsensical. It seems to be a rather good idea (sans the jet engine) as a Baja racer. But for urban ""car chases""? What were they thinking?At the end the narrative of this movie (every criminal is afraid, when they see the batsignal) and the movie reality don't come together.If he disrupts crime, why don't the criminals not just get him into a trap? This Batman would have no chance to get out of it.Maybe Patterson was more a ""Domino Batman"" (Lucky Girl from Deadpool)?But this is not really the batman I want to see.What though made it even worse is the lack of connection between Gothams state and the corruption of the wealthy. All was there in front of our eyes. But the conclusion hasn't been presented. I was hopeful - maybe in any way the movie just showed us, that the system is bad - capitalism is bad (...) - but when we almost could smell this conclusion, Reeves pulled the rug away from under our feet and concluded: Riddler crazy, Batman good, oh - and a Joker is coming.The last point is maybe the most upsetting point. Maybe Bruce Wayne could have become the real hero. Fighting against corporate and legislative corruption - Batman helping him where there are limits to the bureaucratic way... that would have been different......I found Joker just such a master-piece and thought that Batman could be the same. Batman however himself showed himself as shallower than skin-deep. It is an enjoyable movie. But for me, those movies, which had the chance to be great, and just missed real greatness are more upsetting than the movies which are underdogs.",patterson batman exactly concerned news refused work buff bummer hey reef good director make great movie good movie batman movie would probably infinitely better reef would made movie riddler perspective fact sound like fantastic idea make movie batman prey perspective lot criticism might disappeared anyway let talk great stuff cinematography fantastic everything cut perfectly color gamut broody great costume maybe except batsuit scenery done fantastic even better riddler must say especially impressed costume work real context overall riddler fantastic certain scene sure dominating scene batman absolutely great oh penguin crime bossling great stuff colin ferrel really hit hart portrayal one role absolutely mesmerizing colin penguin probably next le grossman tom cruise tropic thunder one best conformation zoey kravitz also fantastic typical role catwoman far grounded version sexy without top strong without unrealistic great stuff felix leiter sorry commissioner gordon also great maybe minute bit awkward overall fantastic even patterson good bit emo scene really could really show pain endured due death parent maybe moment would better bruce wayne story another amajgeddon believable terror attack psychopath also believable let start last point feeling story bit much borrowed zodiac killer mixed saw lacked bit originality also batman supposed best detective really scene talked riddler confronted batman overestimated exactly feeling seemed batman pretty good solving riddle really good detective exactly followed path riddle laid another thing strength weakness power scaling let face patterson batman would already dead particular gadget suit explain dominates also show particular fighting style strength craftiness fighting also smart interacting environment mean bale batman gadget ninja training affleck batman brawn also gadget used element surprise sans ninja even keaton batman combination surprise gadget patterson walking scene believable especially twig apex scene affected riddlers bomb batmobile equally nonsensical seems rather good idea sans jet engine baja racer urban car chase thinking end narrative movie every criminal afraid see batsignal movie reality come together disrupts crime criminal get trap batman would chance get maybe patterson domino batman lucky girl deadpool really batman want see though made even worse lack connection gothams state corruption wealthy front eye conclusion presented hopeful maybe way movie showed u system bad capitalism bad almost could smell conclusion reef pulled rug away foot concluded riddler crazy batman good oh joker coming last point maybe upsetting point maybe bruce wayne could become real hero fighting corporate legislative corruption batman helping limit bureaucratic way would different found joker master piece thought batman could batman however showed shallower skin deep enjoyable movie movie chance great missed real greatness upsetting movie underdog,positive,249

"A languidly-paced, portentous, self-consciously arty franchise movie. It borrows heavily, as so many of these do, from Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER and David Fincher's SE7EN. It has a high-calibre cast. But it also has Robert Pattinson.How to explain Mr Pattinson's career? Here, in THE BATMAN, we have several superb actors. Paul Dano, John Turturro, Colin Farrell, Jeffrey Wright, Peter Skarsgaard, Andy Serkis...I hope there won't be anyone who doubts the excellent quality of that bunch. In movie after movie, they have proved their artistic worth. Zoe Kravitz hasn't had such a long career as those other guys but she is classy in this film and easily able to hold her own with them. And remember that this is a genre film, which brings its own problems for performers. As likely as not, they're going to have to speak convincingly many ridiculously melodramatic lines of dialogue. THE BATMAN is packed with such wannabe profundities, usually whispered in an attempt to disguise their banality. All the above-mentioned actors use their considerable skills to help us forget how hokey is so much they have to say. That's certainly one sign of a quality thesp.However, in the leading role here, that perpetual knitwear model Mr Pattinson wanders around looking haunted without ever commuicating that there's anything at all going on behind the eyes. I've seen a lot of his films, not because I've wanted to see him in them, but because something else has drawn me to them and he happens to be there. Clare Denis' HIGH LIFE is an example. She makes interesting movies, but for some reason she chose Pattinson to be in that one, as did Antonio Campos for his THE DEVIL ALL THE TIME, in which Tom Holland rose to the challenge of conveying a complex character who goes on a tortuous psychological journey. Mr Pattinson took the role of a drunken preacher. A peach of part for an actor. Something to grab, something to chew the scenery with. Pattinson meandered through it as if it were catwalk show. To be fair, he rose to the challenge of Robert Eggers' THE LIGHTHOUSE, but I have a theory about that, which you can share if you read my review of that remarkable flim.Anyway, here, our eponymous Batman, is Robert Pattinson, not a good actor. How does he get these wonderful parts? Is it because of his huge success with the TWILIGHT series, in which he had little to do but pose, and which, like Zoolander, is something he knows how to do? His name attached to a film brings his TWILIGHT fans with him, like casting Daniel Radcliffe guarantees a movie the worldwide Potterhead community. Radcliffe, like Pattinson, is not a good actor, and like Pattinson has been given many acting challenges because from a producer's point of view there's reduced financial risk for such projects than there might be due to the adoring fans. Baffling. I can't understand why, with so many wonderful actors out there, even artistically ambitious directors (it's debatable whether Matt Reeves is one of those) put their faith in the Pattinsons, the Radcliffes and the Emma Watsons. They may be lovely people, for all I know, but, honestly, they are not good actors.So, THE BATMAN is ok, as such films go.

A lot more action and a quicker pace we're needed for it to have been great. Not to mention shave an hour off of the time. Three hours is just too long especially at the pace of this movie.",actor good pleasant surprise robert pattinson good batman zoe kravitz stunning however film slow moving drawn soooo much could cut effected story line well done movie good great lot action quicker pace needed great mention shave hour time three hour long especially pace movie,positive,253
"*Major Spoilers*Aesthetics & Environment:
The aesthetics of Gotham are captured nicely, but very grounded. Basically how would Gotham look like today - with large advertising billboards etc. Scenes capture the gloominess of Gotham nicely. Rainy. Dark. Grey.Batman Myth and Lore Setting:
The myth of Batman is set-up very nicely. 'I don't own the shadows, I am the shadow' - nice. Criminals thinking that Batman is hiding in every shadow. The heavy footsteps of Batman approaching. That gives you genuine fear for what may come from the shadows.Comic Accuracy:
Basically 2/10. Pattinson may be a good Batman but he is NOT a good Bruce Wayne. He kept reminding me of some emo dude who's now Batman. I have watched Batman: Year One, and this Year Two Batman was not even close. Not for once did Pattinson reminded me of Bruce Wayne.Nothing beats Affleck as Bruce Wayne (both the tortured one from BvS, and optimistic one from ZSJL). I repeat, nothing beats Affleck!As for being Batman. I overall liked him. But I will cover that later below in detail.Same goes with other characters. Selina Kyle. Falcone. The Riddler (I cover that later too). Gordon. None of these characters reminded me of who they were supposed to be, even if they are early in their character arcs.Collin Farrell's Oswald Cobblepot is right on the money though. I missed his trick umbrella. But given the grounded nature of the movie, I'll let it go. Lol.The Protagonist:
Pattinson is a good Batman overall. BUT with some huge comic inaccuracies.As I earlier said that the movie is very grounded overall, but still. Batman using an actual realistic wingsuit rather than his cape was the biggest goof for me, and WAY TOO realistic. Even Nolanverse was able to work out cape-flying.This Batman is a recluse. So no strong Wayne Enterprises dynamics in his character either. He's more of a loner guy doing recon on his own, undercover. There is minimal tactical help from Alfred to him. No mission comms between the two either.There were some hits and some misses with this Batman.The Antagonist(s):
Riddler as a standalone serial killer nails it. Is he the Riddler from comics? No. Not really. This is inside the mind of a deranged serial killer, hell bent on delivering his version of justice.Is he scary? 100%. Loved his performance. It really gets under your skin. Genuinely scared the hell out of me in some of the scenes. Especially the opening first one.Oswald Cobblepot is another bullseye. Loved how comic accurate he was. Loved his accent.Carmine Falcone, eh not so much. Didn't look like a mob boss. Bad casting choice, I'd say.Other Characters:
James Gordon is criminally ignored to develop as a character. He remains a static one-dimensional character from beginning till the end. The acting was superb, but his character didn't get much attention it seemed.Same goes with Alfred. There's hardly any dynamics between Alfred & Bruce, or Alfred & Batman. Is Bruce devastated when Alfred is attacked? Yes, obviously. But before that, we hardly see them operating as a duo.The Plot/Story:
It's a detective story at heart. Do NOT expect a lot of action or lengthy hand-to-hand combat sequences (like Batman vs Bane from TDKR, or Warehouse Fight scene from BvS). You have basically seen all the fight sequences in the trailer already. Those are all. It's also a slow burn, with a somewhat explosive third-act.Plot unfolds in a decent pace. It doesn't seemed rushed. Somewhat slow at some points. This allows for good character development. With a few exceptions, mostly characters develop nicely throughout the story.The narrative itself and the parable is highly political in nature. In a nutshell, this-
""Present Day Left America (represented by Batman, Selina & Gordon) trying to save Gotham (representing USA) from Present-Day Right America (represented by Riddler); who is hell bent on delivering his own deranged definition of justice. Mainly triggered because of 'The Sins of their Father' - Orphanage Renewal, Thomas & Martha Wayne's controversial past (representing USA's dark past: slavery etc).""But I'd leave that for your own interpretation :)Cinematography:
Some beautiful and mind-blowing scenes. One of the strongest aspect of this film. The noir is perfectly done.Car chase scene is so superbly done that you can't help but appreciate it. Batmobile kills it. Very ground, but very destructive. You could feel its actual power.The 44 Below scene which takes place in gunshot flashes. OMFG! Although seemed inspired by The Dark Knight Returns (animated) and The Dark Knight Rises (Live Action), but this was the perfect rendition of that scene.Sound and Music:
Sound design is okay. At some points it's nicely done (like car chase), at some points it's weak (Batman's punches felt weaker, even from the trailer). There were NO bone-cracking sounds with his punches.No memorable soundtrack. At some points the soundtrack even seems so generic. Not a strong OST; like those composed by Hans Zimmer or JunkieXL in the past.To Wrap up:
7 / 10
It hits somewhere perfectly. It misses somewhere. It's a good Batman in its own right. But cannot work with DCEU, neither is it very comic accurate. Think of it as Joker (movie). Very much standalone. And very very different - and not in a bad way!

"Pros:
Great and accurate BatmanGreat cinematography and atmosphereGreat sound fxGreat practical fx and set designsGood action sequencesGood acting/characterizationGood soundtrackDecent plot.Cons:
Almost zero emotional depth (Bruce/Alfred and Bruce/Selina relationships aren't explored at all)Forgettable main villain (You could replace Riddler with any generic serial killer)Very uninteresting and uncreative traps/riddles, which is a shame considering who the villain isAverage and sometimes cringey dialogue3rd act makes no sense and feels forced and contrived compared to the first 2.Plenty of plot holes/inconsistencies:Batman and Gordon letting Penguin go after killing possibly dozens of people on the chase sequence, and not even addressing the incident or calling an ambulance.With how damn loud the Batmobile is, how did Batman park it in the hideout without anyone hearing it? How did he teleport from the floor (in the middle of the shootout) to the Batmobile without anyone noticing?If Riddler thought Batman was his ""partner"", why tf did he blow Colson up with him standing an inch away? Also, how tf did Batman survive that and without a scratch on his face?Batman gets absolutely destroyed while gliding and he just stands up and walks it off, when he should've gotten extremely severe injuries, especially since he got bombed right before.Why did the Riddler flood the entire city, killing innocent people too, instead of only targetting corrupt authorities like he was doing the entire time? He just contradicts his entire plan out of nowhere.This one bugged me the most: Riddler sends multiple pictures of people outside of the Iceberg Lounge and not Batman or a single cop decided to find the place where the photos were taken from??? They just had to follow the angle in which the photos were taken and they would've found the Riddler's apartment, or at least gotten some clues from his neighbors.I also had to suspend disbelief like crazy to buy that Alfred wasn't killed by that bomb.Pacing issues, especially with the 3rd act.Overall, as a massive Batman fan I'm happy that I enjoyed a Batman movie after 14 fking years. This is the best version of the character we've had in live action so far imo. The Bruce Wayne persona was clearly intentionally not developed, so I have no issues about that, looking forward to see it in the sequel(s).Technically impressive movie but writing drags it down several points, this is definitely not a masterpiece or close to The Dark Knight for me.

It's really hard not to compare this to the dark Knight. They are both dark and very serious takes on the caped crusader. However the fast pace coupled with iconic scenes of the Dark Knight made that dark take work. The Batman however felt like an overly stretched two part episode of Batman the Animated Series. The pace is very slow and there are no iconic scenes in my opinion. It is very reminiscent of Seven and Zodiac in themes and plot but are comparably lacklustre in execution. That being said everything else is good and if you are a fan of Batman it is still worth checking out but I'd wait for it to pop up on streaming so you can watch it in parts and not get bored.Note: It is not worth staying past the credits.,really hard compare dark knight dark serious take caped crusader however fast pace coupled iconic scene dark knight made dark take work batman however felt like overly stretched two part episode batman animated series pace slow iconic scene opinion reminiscent seven zodiac theme plot comparably lacklustre execution said everything else good fan batman still worth checking wait pop streaming watch part get bored note worth staying past credit,positive,260

"Taking notes from 2019's ""Joker,"" the newest iteration of Batman, which is aptly titled, ""The Batman,"" is a dark, brooding character study that feels less like a superhero film and more of a David Fincher psychological crime drama. Even going as far as to open with a scene of brutal murder, ""The Batman"" is unlike any other live action film that has previously depicted the caped crusader. And with that comes positives and negatives.Batman is by far my favorite superhero - and in this movie, he does not disappoint. Robert Pattinson play a moody, emo, young-adult Bruce Wayne who is obviously not well-adjusted to the world. Sure, he may be a billionaire, but he is no playboy or philanthropist. Instead, this film's Bruce Wayne is a reclusive introvert who spends most of his time prowling the streets at night for his next targets. Yes, Batman is not seeking out to necessarily save people but instead to violently brutalize thugs while telling them that his name is ""Vengeance"" - this leads to a fantastic introduction to Batman's character where he engages in hand to hand combat with a group of thugs, showing absolutely no mercy. It's clear that Bruce/Batman has a lot of pent up aggression; but unlike Affleck's Batman who utilized his raw strength to beat enemies to a pulp, Pattinson is still green. Having been The Dark Knight for only two years, Pattinson portrays a more vulnerable, less careful superhero, one who is getting hurt almost as much as he hurts others. However, instead of packing this film with high-octane fight sequences, ""The Batman"" aims to thrill through its depiction of a noir murder mystery.Paul Dano plays The Riddler, who is keen on picking off Gotham's high profile politicians and law enforcement officials. When the mayor of Gotham is found murdered, Batman must put his patented detective skills to work to figure out who is doing the killing, and why. Due to this change in tone that is so unlike any other Batman movie we've had before, ""The Batman"" has a very methodical, borderline slow-moving pace to it. Combine that with the three-hour long runtime, and you have a recipe for either disaster, or triumph. The long runtime is definitely what is going to turn people off from the film. A three hour superhero movie certainly isn't the norm, and both times I saw this film in theatres, I could definitely pick up on the antsyness of the audience. That said, even with such a long runtime, the movie's pacing is practically perfect. There is always something happening or about to happen, with an action beat occurring every 20 minutes or so. That said, because the movie has such a serious, brooding tone, the film never necessarily feels like it's picking up.It's clear that director Matt Reeves wanted this movie to forego all traditional superhero tropes, and instead cater to slow-burn, adult thrillers. While that can be effective, and is for a majority of the film, in my opinion the slow-burn almost added a level of stagnation to the movie due to the fact that the tone is relentless and constant throughout all three hours of the film. For ""The Batman's"" entirety, the film almost goes out of its way to deny its audience from any high-octane thrills or spectacular action set pieces. Even with the, admittedly, breathtaking car chase that has been featured in virtually every trailer for this movie, even that has a sort of slow-moving, ""artistic"" feel to it because of the fact that Matt Reeves decides to show most of the chase through the point of view of who Batman is chasing. Because of that, you don't get the gorgeous wide shots that you do in, for example, ""The Dark Knight's"" car chase set piece. Instead, in ""The Batman,"" the chase takes place mostly in the cockpit of the vehicles, not allowing you to see the chase in all its glory. Fight sequences are filmed similarly, in that there is almost always something that slightly obscures the action - a scene that immediately comes to mind is a hallway fight that is completely light-less except for occasional bursts of muzzle flair - you may have seen this in the trailer! Yes, it looks beautiful, but the beauty does take away from the intensity of the action.I also had a problem with this movie's villain. While Paul Dano is one of the best actors working today, it is glaringly obvious that his Riddler takes inspiration from another villain who enjoys wearing clown makeup. Additionally, ""The Batman"" lacked the emotional hook that Nolan's movies contained. A common criticism of this film is that there was a lack of emotional resonance, and I agree. I love Batman, obviously, which kept me engaged in the movie, but besides that I never necessarily felt connected to any of the characters. All these negatives aside, ""The Batman,"" does offer a compelling, endlessly watchable Batman adventure. There is a lot to like, and even love, here. Pattinson portrays one of my favorite iterations of both Bruce and Batman, and Matt Reeves packs this film with gorgeous, if relatively unexciting, action sequences. Paul Dano's Riddler has many memorable sequences - I just wish he was in the film more than he is.""The Batman"" won't be everyone's cup of tea. It's long, it's slow, and it's seriousness and darkness doesn't make for the most thrilling movie. However, if you're at all, and in any way, a fan of Batman, you are going to at least like this movie. This is not my favorite Batman movie, but it is one that I am going to rewatch an endless amount of times because, well, it entertained me.

"The Batman is a con trying to pass sadism off as art. Marketing itself as a great procedural in the vein of the nineteen seventies cinema.The Batman is not even in the same league as the great Batman productions of the past. Let alone be compared to Chinatown, Taxi Driver or Klute as a great noir detective flick. Those films had real style and subtle dialogue that suited and ecplored a culture.The Batman is a bad procedural episode of Gotham meets Law & Order dressed up in a bat suit.Is the production design a watered down copy of Fincher's SEVEN, FIGHT CLUB and ZODIAK. Yes.Yet as a fully realized thought provoking film, The Batman is all dress up and posing.Take a bunch of noir movies most millennials never saw or have a clue about and compare them to The Batman..
The Batman is a cheap marketing ploy aimed at an international audience. One where Bang Bang, Crash, boom sells. The Batman is a terrible Batman film and only vaguely resembles Fincher in the most superficial of ways.To compare to Scorsese, John Huston or Polanski in his prime is joke and an amateurish attempt at relevance.Those three films make one realize what The Batman is not. It is not in the same league as those classic noir films. It is not authentic nor specific to a unique vision.It is more like GOTHAM, the TV show than a fully realized Major Motion Picture..
There are so many problems with this film in regards to carrying the torch of Bruce Wayne..
The film is more sadistic than dark. More inauthentic than creative. Just as the crimes are delivered with blunt force trauma, the film is ugly and lacks subtly..
It is a film school hack of Fincher's Seven
shoe horned over the Batman Franchise..
It was obviously made for an International market in the worst way. Dialogue is minimal because nuance of language does not translate or sell to foreign markets. Humor is non specific, because humor does not translate. There is zero humor in this film unless you find the visual ""Thumb-Drive"" funny, in that case you should see a psychologist..
Cinema needs to be specific and about a personal poi TGIF view to achieve an authentic tone..
The Batman is vague and lacks real nuance. This is what you get when you point to world market profits by trying to please as wide a market as possible, as opposed to making a great film. This is a new breed of foreign film geared for greed over the art of cinema..It is a package made for the largest burgeoning market, Asian markets, with its vast potential audience. That is all it is, a C poser version of something vaguely resembling a Batman film. Product exploiting Batman's marketing..
Villains and main characters have a lack of subtlety or character development. It is as if they were dropped in on us. The Riddler's name could be anything other than The Riddler. Gary perhaps. Psychotic Gary. His riddles are neither intriguing or intelligent. Yet the stupidest dolt in the theater can figure it out in seconds.These kind of villains are given titles of the Riddler or Joker, without earning the position. The drop in assuming we will rely on our preconceived knowledge. This makes the film lazy and incomplete..
I am sorry but vague moodiness, bad lighting and long slow plodding set pieces does not make it art..
It is boring, long on exposition for the sole purpose of moving plot without creating empathy for any character. There is no heart nor any real Batman DNA to care about..
It is all dress up with weak convictions and the worst car chase scene in the history of the bat mobile, if you could call it that..
Damn I hated this movie. I Am a huge Batman fan and this is easily a swing and a miss..
PS - Bob Kane's Batman goes all the way back to the 1930s. The 1950's & 1960s were a Golden Era of Batman comics. This Movie is a sullied, sadistic attempt to highjack the franchise as product. Purely a cynical money grab to exploit the franchise, especially in non-English speaking markets..

"The Batmen is another adaptation of the story of the dark crusader who is played by Robert Patterson. I got to say he was the worst Batman actor, he looked sick, boring and predictable. Zoe Kravitz played Catwoman where she was good but not sexy, she was supposed to be a cat burglar but we don't see any of it. The real stars of the movie were Paul Dano and Colin Farrell as the Riddler and the Penguin, they brought the story to life. The movie was just too damn long and I know why, each scene was over composed with slow motion production, just way too much of it. God, I just couldn't wait for it to finish. In this movie Batman acts as a crime solving murder mystery filled with corruption, bribery, and darkness. I expected something better, something more, Affleck was a better Batman, just don't bother with this one. It is not great, just good.

It was all BLAH. Also, don't stay for the after credit scene because there isn't one. Just a question mark.I'm ok with a serious take on the Dark Knight but it should still be fun, or exciting, or suspenseful. This movie had NONE of that. They set up the characters for a second feature, hopefully they hire a different director and writers.Also, there were points in the movie where they sped up Catwoman's actions hoping no one would see it.

"This is not the worst movie I have seen this year, it is not even the worst movie I have seen this week, but oh boy is this boring. They try to make a artsy dark Batman with a gloomy feel, deeply relying on acting and music to save scenes and ultimately the movie. They failed.This should have been a good fit. It was raining before I headed into the movie theatre. I was a bit buzzed from a few single malt. I also went into this movie with very, very low expectations. So the tone and attempt at this, somewhat, depressing Batman should have worked perfectly well. It didn't.So what is wrong with this?Well, first of all this does not feel like a superhero movie. This is a moody Robert fighting some criminals dressed up as batman in a generic dark action movie. As such that is not necessarily a bad thing, and I will give them a point for at least trying something new with the character. The problem is that Batman is inherently dark, both literarily and as a character. To make him even darker, moodier, more goth, with no real happy ending and lots of people dying just make the audience feel like you overdoing it. It is like putting 10 slices of cheese on your burger, at some point it stop being a burger and instead becomes a pile of cheese.Secondly several of the actors are horribly miscast. Zoë Kravitz, which was my main concern beforehand is actually better than I thought. She and Robert Pattinson are both pretty good and mostly do a great job. The problem is that neither one of them should be playing the character they are playing. Robert would have been perfect to play the Riddler for example, and Zoë should not have been in this movie. They are good, but not in their respective character. And the same can be said for almost everyone. Andy Serkis, whom I love, is great as always but why was he cast to play Alfred? Over and over, character after character, is miscast. As said they all do a good job acting, but they are playing the wrong character and it shows.Thirdly the dark tone coupled with over the top bombastic music with several miscasts while they are trying to make things, in lack of a better word, be more ""realistic"", almost come off as comedy. There was so many times in this movie I was thinking that this should have a laugh track and Ba Dum Tss, and I would not even raise an eyebrow because it would make sense.Worst though is how boring this is. I was so, so bored... I cannot remember the last time I was this bored at the cinema. Sure this has some action, but things move so slow, pacing is way off, and I always felt like they try to convey some artsy gloomy batman instead of moving the plot forward. This does not have to be agonisingly 2 hours and 45min long, because boy do you feel it... so, so boring...The good thing is that they tried something new. Plus points for that. And the story is not bad. Besides some unnecessary family side-quest this has a decent story. And as mention above the acting is good, just wrong actors in the wrong roles. They also have a few cool scenes which, unless you fall asleep from bordom before they happen, you will really enjoy.I give this a 3/10, but at least 2 points is deducted for how boring and long this movie is. If you can stand the dark tone and slow moving plot lines while Robert dress up as Batman, well then you might enjoy this. For me though I am never watching this again unless I want to fall asleep.",worst movie seen year even worst movie seen week oh boy boring try make artsy dark batman gloomy feel deeply relying acting music save scene ultimately movie failed good fit raining headed movie theatre bit buzzed single malt also went movie low expectation tone attempt somewhat depressing batman worked perfectly well wrong well first feel like superhero movie moody robert fighting criminal dressed batman generic dark action movie necessarily bad thing give point least trying something new character problem batman inherently dark literarily character make even darker moodier goth real happy ending lot people dying make audience feel like overdoing like putting slice cheese burger point stop burger instead becomes pile cheese secondly several actor horribly miscast zo kravitz main concern beforehand actually better thought robert pattinson pretty good mostly great job problem neither one playing character playing robert would perfect play riddler example zo movie good respective character said almost everyone andy serkis love great always cast play alfred character character miscast said good job acting playing wrong character show thirdly dark tone coupled top bombastic music several miscasts trying make thing lack better word realistic almost come comedy many time movie thinking laugh track ba dum tss would even raise eyebrow would make sense worst though boring bored cannot remember last time bored cinema sure action thing move slow pacing way always felt like try convey artsy gloomy batman instead moving plot forward agonisingly hour min long boy feel boring good thing tried something new plus point story bad besides unnecessary family side quest decent story mention acting good wrong actor wrong role also cool scene unless fall asleep bordom happen really enjoy give least point deducted boring long movie stand dark tone slow moving plot line robert dress batman well might enjoy though never watching unless want fall asleep,negative,273

Not a great Batman film, but a good one. It was not as good as the Dark Knight trilogy, but it's definitely better than the rest. The greatest thing about the film was how they made it to actually be a detective movie. Which is what DC stands for, Detective Comics. The acting was flawless, Robert Pattinson played the role well, the Riddler was creepy and great, up until he actually showed his face, he just turned comical after that. I wish they showed more of Alfred, he was only in like 3 scenes. It was very well made, it had an eerie feel that is suitable for Gotham, there were cool visuals and memorable lines.The biggest disappointment for me was how he was trying to solve what the Riddler was up to, throughout the movie, but there was never a moment where all of the pieces came together.

"I'm giving it a 5/10 just because I believe it's a decent movie and a decent storyline. The tone is dark, the action when it happens it's intense, the tension is there... You can feel the noir and the thriller all the way through.I went with high expectations due to the amazing reviews I was reading before entering the cinema. However there are a few reasons why I don't consider it that great whatsoever:1. It's long and slow. This wouldn't need to be a problem, I've seen many long slow-paced movies and TV series. The problem comes when you actually feel how long it is, hence it can turn out feeling boring sometimes.2. Yes, it's true that this is probably the most detective-like live-action Batman we've ever seen. However and besides the use of some gadgets from time to time I don't have a Batman feeling, he just shows up wearing the suit and beating people up or walks through the main door to check something.3. I'm not saying Pattinson does a bad acting job, because he doesn't. But there's NOTHING in his role that makes me think of Bruce Wayne in any way other than the fact that that's how people refers to him in the movie. If someone would have told me he has a different name I'd believed it, because I don't see the Wayne identity in him. And I see this problem in every I-should-know-you character. Alfred is a sad old man without a nice Brittish accent or a nice I-make-fun-of-Bruce sense of humor. Selina just feels like Catwoman when she's throwing a kick or scratching someone.I don't know.

"The new big screen reboot of DC Comics' iconic superhero by writer and director Matt Reeves has a very promising and strong start, but somewhere in the second half drops the ball hard and struggles to keep the sinking ship floating above the water, not helped in any way by its unnecessarily long runtime.The first half of the movie presents some of the best scenes in the cinematic history of the Caped Crusader, in regard to atmosphere, world building, character relations, and its portrayal of the detective and identity of the titular character. The look and feel of Gotham City were both familiar yet distinctive, a unique environment but not that unrecognizable from everyday life. The incorporation of gritty realism into the world of fantasy was previously attempted by Christopher Nolan in his trilogy of films, here Reeves and company take it to the next level and portray a level of danger that was only briefly touched upon but not explored to its fullest. The occasional horror elements are also applied effectively, creating some genuinely suspenseful and intense moments that will make some movie goers feel uncomfortable. Helping with the mood is the dynamic musical score by Michael Giacchino and wonderful cinematography. Robert Pattinson's portrayal of the iconic hero works well in the context of this particular story, staying true to the concept that Batman is the real identity and Bruce Wayne is the empty shell of a man that is an infringement on his life. I have been reading Batman comic books since the age of seven, and while aspects of Pattinson's portrayal are foreign to me, there are little things that I can appreciate.Other members in the cast are good to serviceable. Jeffrey Wright makes a fine Jim Gordon, Andy Serkis puts a fine stamp on the character of Alfred Pennyworth, Colin Farrell is unrecognizable and a little fun as The Penguin though I am not sure if I would give him a spin-off as has been said to be in the works. John Turturro is excellent as Falcone, so good I wish the marketing made his presence stronger his performance should be talked about more in reviews. Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet's daughter Zoe makes a fine Selina Kyle, she's not very believable in an action role or looks like she could really be very skilled in hand-to-hand combat, but her outfit is certainly more fight ready than, say, Anne Hathaway's in 2012's The Dark Knight Rises. Paul Dano's The Riddler is not The Riddler, in all my years absorbing content related to Batman this version of the character's relations to the source material are strictly in-name-only, they could have been another of Batman's rogues or a completely new character and it wouldn't alter the film's plot whatsoever. Dano is good in the film, but his character is not The Riddler.Where the movie falls apart entirely is halfway in, with a line Catwoman expresses to our hero on the rooftop where the bat signal stands ready to shine into the night sky. It is from that moment on that the fridge has been nuked and it never fully recovers from that. At that point, real world contemporary politics are brought into the picture, and they persist further in sometimes subtle and other time insidious ways. The line in subject, which has been brought up many times right now from others, is not another throwaway line of dialog or to virtue signal but as an expressive marker for the film's subtext and underlying themes. The themes and the subtext in conversation reiterate talking points often seen in the media of our world and there is not-too-subtle biblical reinterpretation lending itself to ideology that ultimately make it a point that this Batman movie is not really about escapism, it's more about a message. How this message will be received time will tell, but I feel the majority of viewers would prefer to see a Batman movie carrying themes and subtext with more subtlety and universality - but I suppose in that regard my expectations might be a bit too high given that Matt Reeves is a Bad Robot alumni and whose friends JJ Abrams and Damon Lindelof like to deconstruct and make many big ""choices"" in their work.That problematic line of dialog and accompanying underlying themes and subtext might not have been that apparent for some people if only the movie's pacing were stronger. At roughly three hours in length, the film's remaining second and entire third half feel very long and tedious. I have seen all Batman movies produced for the screen, and this may be the first time I have ever mindfully asked the question, ""when is the intermission?"" There is a lot going on in the movie, and to be honest some things may have been better off left at the cutting room floor or saved for a director's cut as they derailed the flow of the movie, and all major action beats after felt like loud whispers.The action itself is serviceable but not very impressive, a lot of that is the result of too many quick cuts and close-ups in addition to darkly lit environments which diminish the effect of the spectacle. However, there is not really many action set pieces in this, which some may find to be disappointing.This is not really a 'fun' kind of movie, it's as serious and straight forward as the thrillers it takes inspiration from like Se7en and Zodiac. The storyline is also best consumed by adult viewers, younger viewers not so much, I think the appeal of seeing Batman in live action will lose its wonderment quickly, and they find themselves wanting to consume other material with these characters. I wouldn't recommend a parent take their child to see this movie either due to its mature content and intense scenes, you are probably better off buying them toys from the movie and encourage them to use their imaginations to develop their own Batman narrative with the figures.Could've been great, but as it is it has great moments but is ultimately too long and overindulges itself to the point where it feels a bit pretentious at times.Maybe the sequel will be better, but after leaving the theater I didn't really feel like this world needs much further exploration. I cannot really see Robert Pattinson's Batman going up against a Mr. Freeze or a Bane or a Ra's Al Ghul, or even interact with a Superman or a Wonder Woman.",new big screen reboot dc comic iconic superhero writer director matt reef promising strong start somewhere second half drop ball hard struggle keep sinking ship floating water helped way unnecessarily long runtime first half movie present best scene cinematic history caped crusader regard atmosphere world building character relation portrayal detective identity titular character look feel gotham city familiar yet distinctive unique environment unrecognizable everyday life incorporation gritty realism world fantasy previously attempted christopher nolan trilogy film reef company take next level portray level danger briefly touched upon explored fullest occasional horror element also applied effectively creating genuinely suspenseful intense moment make movie goer feel uncomfortable helping mood dynamic musical score michael giacchino wonderful cinematography robert pattinson portrayal iconic hero work well context particular story staying true concept batman real identity bruce wayne empty shell man infringement life reading batman comic book since age seven aspect pattinson portrayal foreign little thing appreciate member cast good serviceable jeffrey wright make fine jim gordon andy serkis put fine stamp character alfred pennyworth colin farrell unrecognizable little fun penguin though sure would give spin said work john turturro excellent falcone good wish marketing made presence stronger performance talked review lenny kravitz lisa bonet daughter zoe make fine selina kyle believable action role look like could really skilled hand hand combat outfit certainly fight ready say anne hathaway dark knight rise paul dano riddler riddler year absorbing content related batman version character relation source material strictly name could another batman rogue completely new character alter film plot whatsoever dano good film character riddler movie fall apart entirely halfway line catwoman express hero rooftop bat signal stand ready shine night sky moment fridge nuked never fully recovers point real world contemporary politics brought picture persist sometimes subtle time insidious way line subject brought many time right others another throwaway line dialog virtue signal expressive marker film subtext underlying theme theme subtext conversation reiterate talking point often seen medium world subtle biblical reinterpretation lending ideology ultimately make point batman movie really escapism message message received time tell feel majority viewer would prefer see batman movie carrying theme subtext subtlety universality suppose regard expectation might bit high given matt reef bad robot alumnus whose friend jj abrams damon lindelof like deconstruct make many big choice work problematic line dialog accompanying underlying theme subtext might apparent people movie pacing stronger roughly three hour length film remaining second entire third half feel long tedious seen batman movie produced screen may first time ever mindfully asked question intermission lot going movie honest thing may better left cutting room floor saved director cut derailed flow movie major action beat felt like loud whisper action serviceable impressive lot result many quick cut close ups addition darkly lit environment diminish effect spectacle however really many action set piece may find disappointing really fun kind movie serious straight forward thriller take inspiration like se en zodiac storyline also best consumed adult viewer younger viewer much think appeal seeing batman live action lose wonderment quickly find wanting consume material character recommend parent take child see movie either due mature content intense scene probably better buying toy movie encourage use imagination develop batman narrative figure could great great moment ultimately long overindulges point feel bit pretentious time maybe sequel better leaving theater really feel like world need much exploration cannot really see robert pattinson batman going mr freeze bane ra al ghul even interact superman wonder woman,positive,282

"LIKES:The Acting:
A strong opening for much of the film, the Batman's cast excels where other directions in the DC movies have not hit so hard. Jeffrey Wright is a wonderful Commissioner Gordon. He's got great character development with a wonderful delivery of the frustration he is facing in this mystery. Kravitz as the new Selena Kyle is the blend of physical and emotional acting that this character holds, being one of the best Catwoman roles in a long time. She's got the moves during the fights, but the heart of the anti-hero is solid, and a great opposite to the Bat in this game of uncovering the truth. As for all the other characters, I could go on paragraphs alone of how well they hit their marks in this blend of modern with classic Batman, but I can say Reeves has helmed quite a cast to bring this new approach to life. As for Pattinson, I did not hate him, and feel he pulled the Tenet and Lighthouse acting into a role that is dark, foreboding, and angry as expected in the first two years of the Bat's career. From a story aspect it works, and Pattinson manages to pull some great punches into handling the emotional role, while the broodiness makes for a simplistic and monotone character that pales to the others in this film.The World Building:
Reeves has done a great job establishing the new direction with the Gotham City and pulls you into just how dark and dingy the city of Batman is. While Tim Burton's style was a playful, whimsical architecture that captured lots of styles, Reeves take is more realistic and feels very much like a city in need of cleaning up. All the shadows, the designs of the clubs and buildings have shed the comic book feeling, and instead dove into more of the graphic novel, realism approach that goes so well with the story. It sets the stage for lots of story potential in what will most likely have sequels, and offers many facets of the city to make an ecosystem that Batman will be playing in. All the designs and new angles they took were wonderful for me and the story elements for our Bat to face will evolve well if done right.The Cinematography:
It's good, and Reeves has indeed shot a great movie that looks beautiful on just a simple screen. The shadows tell lots of stories in this movie, with plenty of angles and use to establish the mood and dangers of the criminal world we are in. Filters that add grey help further add the foreboding nature of this film, giving us the feeling that even light does not bring safety in this Seven like approach they took. Even the angles taken for how light serves as a temporary reprieve are shot beautifully, with so much captured in the lighting and angles, each shot meticulously planned to give you the optimum emotion and punch that they needed. This is a film that will do well in the IMAX films, and will probably look even better on and advanced screen.The Costumes/Makeup:
I have to give him props to the wardrobe/makeup team, because they have accomplished wonders in this film. The Bat suit looks good, it's dark, it's basic, and fits the early years approach they are taking quite well like an early Spiderman suit from Marvel, though the eye issues are still present. The rest of the group has some style to it, and keeps the realistic edge of the movie, but still holds the comic book basis that we love to see in this franchise. Throw in wigs, outfits for a little more elevation and there is a nice style that many will enjoy for one reason or the other. The biggest achievement though is the Penguin's makeup, and just the transformation they did to the actor to make him into the future villain we know him to be.The Action Scenes to A Level:
As this movie gears towards realism, the action fits the themes as well, bringing bouts that feel as if they can actually happen and not quite as cartoony as the old Batman movies. When guys take punches, they feel it and get some shiners in the process, leading to more street brawling and timing hits than the spectacles of coordination. Catwoman's moves are sleek and stylish, and also have a level of planning that again goes with the themes of the film and don't go too elaborate. Even the chase scene holds more realism to it, and though has a little more octane added to the mix, keeps itself grounded compared to most modern-day car chase sequences. These fights hold more emotional stakes than anything, with Reeves again infusing a storytelling atmosphere to the shots that sort of illustrates the struggles our characters are facing. That symbolic nature gets thumbs up in terms of the balance it gives and how there is an anchor between physical action and the character development with it.The Plot:
Hands down, the best part of this movie for me, is the storytelling they are doing with this film and how it works with the three hours it has. The Batman is a much darker take on an already dark series, taking the elements from the Nolan series, and further swimming down into the tales this film has to offer. While there are plenty of symbolism moments that many will enjoy, the true genius is the mystery at hand within the Riddler's game. What starts out as an homage to the crime genre, quickly blends the Riddler's love of games with the new twist of deadliness not found in other media, a realistic danger that is very relevant to today's world. With the race against the clock, the stakes, and the mystery all dancing around pieces of information that talk more about our characters, it's a captivating moment that will get your intrigue going and keep you hooked through most of the movie. This is the biggest strength for me in this movie, and certainly a major supporting pillar for this film to base itself on.DISLIKES:Batman/Bruce Wayne's portrayal:
Can't say that I enjoyed the brooding, anguished, and monotone Bruce Wayne who bled into the same thing during Batman. I understand that there are often very little differences between the two in the medium, but other Batman movies have tried to utilize the alter egos a little more than what this installment did. Pattinson was fine in acting it out, but the fact they could not do more with the two personas to help gather more clues and keep the trail off of him a little better makes for a flatter Batman that again, is sort of weaker than the other characters in the film.More Alfred:
Ironically, I really liked this Alfred we got, and this butler character has been a staple to the franchise for longer than I've been alive. While Serkis' performance is stellar, the class, emotion, and depth all there ready to go, I must say they sort of short seated him more than they did Batman and Robin's legendary character. More time was needed with Alfred, perhaps to help elevate the Bruce Wayne moments, or perhaps to put his own hat in the ring of solving the Riddler mystery. While Serkis manages to maximize the small amount of time with quality acting, this is the character I wanted more of in this film to help keep the quality performances coming and the promise of what is to come in this latest franchise.The Action to Another Degree:
I know, this movie was going for something different, taking the realistic and brooding approach, compared to the man in tights feel we've gotten several times. It does not mean it had to be devoid of special effects and Hollywood magic to the point of being a little too plain and simplified for my superhero taste. The action of The Batman needs a bit more spice for people like me, mixing some big-time score, a little more coordination and gadgets we love, and trying to add a little more comic book element to relieve some of the darker tones. As I said, the action plays to the rules well, but the lack of adding sound editing, an upbeat score and variety to the fights makes the action part of this movie a little dull for me. Much of the film is really more about that brutality and anger component, something symbolism guys will eat up, but to not add a little variety until the very end (which is still not that spiced up) makes for a bit of a boring and bland Batman film.Too Much in One Film?I always think that studios try to do too much in one movie and push one or two steps too far to try and get all the stuff in. The Batman is a movie that I think took one or two steps that needed to be pulled back, leading to some components feeling a bit forced, not needed, or dare I say semi-complete in my book. This film has a lot of staples in the film, and while many of them are fantastically blending, there are other that are combed over and left vague, probably for the plans I read about the franchises to come. Sadly, like Disney, it seems WB is using this film as a springboard for an entire world of cinema, and those qualities sort of showed as hooks to reel you in to remakes and redos of Batman stories.The Invincible Suit:
You've seen the trailers enough time to know that this Batman seems to have a suit made by Iron Man, and I can't say I'm a big fan of it. All the realism, the bland fights, and the emotions are fine and dandy, but to throw it all away by making a Batman suit that can take a lot of fire and have little repercussions, takes away from the danger element in these moments. While I know Batman has had some blows bounce off, most of the Batman media puts a lot more danger that requires him to fight smarter, displaying Batman's intellect and preparation. This film though, makes his prototype first suit better than most of his later models, leaving me rolling my eyes at the absurdity of how proof his suit is in this installment. While the ending finally cracks that code, it's a broken mechanic and my least favorite aspect of the movie, due to how much it breaks the mold of what Reeves established in this movie.My scores for this film are:Action/Crime/Drama: 8.5

"Have people forgotten what a good movie is? Because this is a really good movie, borderline great, And? People call it out as slow and boring... That is not good enough critique! That is lazy viewing. I saw a lot of these type of reviews for other Matt Reeves films that I found equally baffling. He is a solid director formulating a strong resume of material.Obviously this film is polarizing. Seems like people either love or hate it, not a lot in-between. I think a lot of viewers today need constant stimulation, like in Spiderman No Way Home. A movie like that is adored for easy, light approach, regardless of insipid story elements straight out of the kiddie pool. That movie chases a world saving plot line that stems from... a teenagers issues with image and applying to college. In The Batman, concerns are real - the tone is dark, and the main character has to earn his way to victory. I also think many viewers are turned off by the all too human nature of this Batman version. Not me! That is the essence of that hero! And I love Pattinson's interpretation of this character; the character built through round tables and rehearsal.It is a long movie. Too long? I think so, especially the third act that seems to conclude about 6 times, before actually ending. I understand the desire to include all these story elements and extend the reach of the villain, but it seemed very difficult to maintain proper pace through the films final 40 minutes.But up to that point? I was fully engaged and mesmerized by the high quality film making, characters and their performances.What defines The Batman? I would call it a coming of age story where Batman re-discovers himself, the hero - his place in Gotham, and who and what he cares about. This version of Batman is arrived at fully formed - his presence within the city is understood by all elements, and accepted (grudgingly) by law enforcement. The villain comes off as very complicated, even somewhat likable. His crimes have vision and intelligence, even if ultimately he is a wildly damaged individual who is bent by pursuing chaos. The Batman shows the protagonist and antagonist as two sides of the same coin, but how important morality is in arriving at heroic conclusions. This exploration is enhanced by the Cat-woman character that is driven by revenge, but through her interaction with Batman, makes different choices than she otherwise might.Like Reeves other films, The Batman is deep, textured (visually and thematically) and meaningful. I also found it to be fabulous entertainment.",people forgotten good movie really good movie borderline great people call slow boring good enough critique lazy viewing saw lot type review matt reef film found equally baffling solid director formulating strong resume material obviously film polarizing seems like people either love hate lot think lot viewer today need constant stimulation like spiderman way home movie like adored easy light approach regardless insipid story element straight kiddie pool movie chase world saving plot line stem teenager issue image applying college batman concern real tone dark main character earn way victory also think many viewer turned human nature batman version essence hero love pattinson interpretation character character built round table rehearsal long movie long think especially third act seems conclude time actually ending understand desire include story element extend reach villain seemed difficult maintain proper pace film final minute point fully engaged mesmerized high quality film making character performance defines batman would call coming age story batman discovers hero place gotham care version batman arrived fully formed presence within city understood element accepted grudgingly law enforcement villain come complicated even somewhat likable crime vision intelligence even ultimately wildly damaged individual bent pursuing chaos batman show protagonist antagonist two side coin important morality arriving heroic conclusion exploration enhanced cat woman character driven revenge interaction batman make different choice otherwise might like reef film batman deep textured visually thematically meaningful also found fabulous entertainment,positive,290
"First off. Robert Pattinson makes a great Batman. He's intense, still raw an dcarries a large chip on his shoulder. His Batman is presented as someone who is mysterious, dangerous and quite possibly unstable. Colin Farrell is great as the Penguin but is given too little to do - more of him would have added to the film. Paul Dano makes an OK and very different Riddler.. Zoe Kravitz could have been any woman in a catsuit with a half-assed woolen mask on. She had no personality other than anger and more anger. She was not Selina Kyle, she was just some woman in a mask. The rest of the characters were drawn so very blandly. Andy Serkis was OK as Alfred but it was really just a bit part. John Turturro, a terrific actor, was wasted in the role of Falcone.On top of all that, the plot was convoluted to say the least and the only chemistry in the film was between Batman and the Penguin. Cut an hour out and revamp some of the characters and you'd have a pretty good movie.

"After seeing this latest version of the Caped Crusader which has been around in comic books since 1939, I thought that this epic take on Batman was a bit darker than Batman V Superman yet can't reach the peakness that was The Dark Knight, released during a time when there was no pandemic and interest was high after Heath Ledger died. The film takes place durin Batman's young adult years, skipping when Bruce's parents were murdered and jumping straight into the action and drama. Among the friends and fiends he faces are the Catwoman, the Penguin, and The Riddler, not to mention The Joker at the very end of the movie which paves way for a sequel which might happen given that this movie is doing quite well at the box office despite high ticket prices at chains like AMC and Regal. Watch it in Imax or Dolby and enjoy the great score by Michael Giacchino. The cinematography is very dark and can be bright during rave scenes. Sound mix is very good and the action is very real. Even though its rated PG-13, it might not be for younger kids due to the language and brutal action.",seeing latest version caped crusader around comic book since thought epic take batman bit darker batman v superman yet reach peakness dark knight released time pandemic interest high heath ledger died film take place durin batman young adult year skipping bruce parent murdered jumping straight action drama among friend fiend face catwoman penguin riddler mention joker end movie pave way sequel might happen given movie quite well box office despite high ticket price chain like amc regal watch imax dolby enjoy great score michael giacchino cinematography dark bright rave scene sound mix good action real even though rated pg might younger kid due language brutal action,positive,292
Have no idea HOW this movie has an 8.5 rating.It's such an average movie. It's neither good as a detective (there are many detective movies (e.g. Like Seven) that are much better) and it's neither good as a superhero movie.No deeper message. No impressive fights.

"That's 3 hours of my life I'm never getting back. I realized few minutes in, that it would be a painful watch because I couldn't wait for it to be over, and I was correct. Robert Pattinson is a skilled actor, but he simply does not have what it takes to be Batman. This film was even more painful to watch than emo Peter Parker, and that's saying a lot. The Batman was dull; the dialogues were pointless and uninspired, the storyline utterly uninteresting, I didn't care about any of the characters or what became of them. Batman was a depressed introvert with bad hygiene, 0 charisma, 0 presence, 0 redeeming qualities. If they'd at least put some gore in this 3 hour snoozefest, there might have been something that made me feel anything, watching this, but alas there was not.

"People who made this movie managed to do pretty much everything wrong. Well, actually, they managed to somehow artificially pump its rating here, but everything else about it is a bust.The story is a lousy mess. It is actually a jumble of several stories that are all mashed together to get a terrible mess. Perhaps because of it the movie is way, way too long and just when you think it is finally over, it goes on and on and on because there is still another storyline to pursue.The tone is all wrong. It is neither a serious movie (although you can see it is trying so hard to be) nor a superhero movie. There are so many parts that were supposed to be heavy and dramatic, but just turned out over the top pathetic. Every part that was supposed to be a deep, serious drama just looks like something a high school kid wrote. On the other hand, there is not enough action for it to be a real superhero movie, and the action scenes range between bad and laughable.Finally, Pattinson is just plain wrong for this role. He is not Batman, period. He comes across as a mopey emo kid. Batman should be strong, commanding, even menacing. Pattinson is nothing like that. He is just mopey. In the scenes where he is supposed to impose himself (like when he's supposed to make cops let him search the crime scene just with his commanding, menacing presence) he looks like a kid in a costume that nobody would take seriously. On top of that, he is not right for the part physically. Batman is supposed to be strong physically as well as mentally, but Pattinson almost looks emaciated. And to top it all, his acting is bad, verging on terrible. Apart from this, I have only seen him in Tenet, so I can't comment on his acting as a whole, but here he is lousy. His delivery in those dramatic scenes is something straight out of an elementary school play.Add to all this the bad and uninteresting script, forced and unbelievable romance, and lame antagonists, and you get a 3 hour long try-hard bore fest.",people made movie managed pretty much everything wrong well actually managed somehow artificially pump rating everything else bust story lousy mess actually jumble several story mashed together get terrible mess perhaps movie way way long think finally go still another storyline pursue tone wrong neither serious movie although see trying hard superhero movie many part supposed heavy dramatic turned top pathetic every part supposed deep serious drama look like something high school kid wrote hand enough action real superhero movie action scene range bad laughable finally pattinson plain wrong role batman period come across mopey emo kid batman strong commanding even menacing pattinson nothing like mopey scene supposed impose like supposed make cop let search crime scene commanding menacing presence look like kid costume nobody would take seriously top right part physically batman supposed strong physically well mentally pattinson almost look emaciated top acting bad verging terrible apart seen tenet comment acting whole lousy delivery dramatic scene something straight elementary school play add bad uninteresting script forced unbelievable romance lame antagonist get hour long try hard bore fest,negative,296
"I love Batman, I grew up with Batman and have read SO many Batman comics--so I've seen all the different faces he can wear and all the different interpretations of him by various authors. This is by far the WORST kind.Bruce Wayne/Batman is a joke. He literally the punch line. He looks pathetic, acts pathetic, and is 100% ineffective at stopping the villain he's up against. At best he manages to stop some collateral damage. Pathetic.Alfred, though I love Andy Serkis, is also much stupider than he should be and tolerates way too much crap from Bruce.Catwoman's portrayal is MUCH better, and I loved it. The one negative is that she simultaneously refers to her girlfriend as, well, her girlfriend and as a child. This is the result of smashing two characters into one--as I doubt DC meant to imply that Selina's a pedophile.Matt Reeves sacrificed any and all substance for aesthetic in this film and it's a boring, already been done aesthetic at that. You can literally pick out which comic book stories he was pulling from, but it's also painfully obvious that no one bothered to tell him why those comics were so popular in the first place--the themes, the character development... ugh.

Catwoman, hah, not even like the character from the comics, poor, lives in a dump, friend is being abused and used and she only decides to help her and get her passport back when her life's at stake, why not get it for her before all this with her skills? Zoe, sometimes looked like a hot young woman, although we're not allowed to think this about Catwoman according to her and I didn't with Catwoman, her mask was like something out of a junk store, she also looked like a little 12 year old sometimes, which was a but weird, especially when Batman's kissing her. So sex appeal at all and sorry, but Catwoman is all about this and uses this to her advantage throughout all the comic history, but Zoe knows better than the original creators for the character. Did not like her like her line about getting rich white privileged, why does colour always have to come into it? Gordon, quality actor, always good, only likeable character in the film. Robert was surprisingly good as Batman, but terrible as Bruce Wayne, just looks so wrong, he looks more like The Joker or Batman who Laughs. Story is mediocre, long, boring, and just when i thought it had finally finished, it went on some more, then some more and then more again. Can't think true Batman comic fans would think this is really good? First 10 mins, I thought I was in for a treat, as it started off a bit Frank Miller like, but that soon fell flat.

"I don't believe it's worth 8.4 rating. I'll admit I was not a fan of Pattinson to begin but optimistic about the writers and directors being confident and me being a real cinema enthusiast. It showcases Pattinson and his (one-trick resume) acting style. The characters and most acting was great. Oswald, Riddler, Gordon, Catwoman were all good adaptations. I wish some of the of the lines were more thought out and not corny. Like how I wish Gordon was more defensive for his new Batman, just in making his fellow co-workers to appreciate what they are trying to do. Also, the way ""the Bat"" talks to Alfred was just kind of angry/careless, it seemed like a scared kid that was hardly even becoming a man. I just didn't see it as necessary or at least could've been written differently. I also thought maybe we would have him truly a body transformation and lift weights, if we were going the way of a angry/vengeful young Hero. The movie could've easily had 35 minutes cut out. Some of the Riddlers rantings just seemed too much and tiring. I would've liked to see more action in all because there really was not many good sequences with gadgets or batmobile type action. Colin Farrell is a way under-rated actor, and Paul Dano was great. Overall I was not impressed, and since we had to postpone again and again and then raise the movie theatre prices just for this, ""the Batman"" movie. Maybe they're just pushing for new standard fees with all this covid nonsense and inflation is a good excuse I suppose. Understanding people like myself will continue to pay but there is a point that will end the movie theatre experience for a lot of people I feel. Anyways, if this is just the start to the new franchise, I won't be in line for the next one. I hope it works out for the newer generation that does not know much about the former films.

"Given the current landscape of superhero movies, (in several ways) ""The Batman"" is something different; and that definitely works in its favor. Namely, Robert Pattinson, whose performance walks the fine line between hurt and rage. He wears the pain of Bruce's childhood trauma on his sleeve, but brings such ferocity to his street justice. I have to give the man credit; this is a performance that sets his interpretation apart from previous Bat actors.But also (and this was my favorite aspect of the marketing campaign), Batman is an honest-to-god detective - something I've waited years to see on the big screen - and it fits this movie like a glove.This isn't my favorite Batman movie; the running time works against it, as well as the atmosphere that derives too much from ""The Crow"" and ""Seven"". And I appreciated it more from a technical standpoint which, since we're talking a superhero movie, surprised me a little. The camerawork, makeup and sound design are superb, and the Batmobile chase scene is nothing short of jaw-dropping. However, credit to Matt Reeves for giving this Dark Knight a character arc. I think it strengthens the third act immensely.I can't honestly gauge this film's replay value, but I enjoyed seeing it, and I'm up for a sequel.

"Take an hour off this movie and it'll be ok, as it is I was in tears begging for mercy come the end. ""Please, please let it end."" I wimpered, as the next and seemingly final scene appeared but alas no, it didn't, the torture was immense. Trying too hard to be the Oh so dark anti hero movie we all know Batman to be. Trying too hard to impress with nothing new. Trying to hard with a story line we all know like the back of our hands. A score equally overly dark as Nivana and Kurt Cobain's voice constantly ring out. All this combined produced a failure of a movie as dark and depressing as this adaptation of Batman.Acting was good on a whole apart from the glaringly obvious failure of The Batman himself, trying too hard to be the anti rich kid. He brought nothing to the screen nor did Catwoman both a disappointment. The supporting cast were good and did the best they could with what they were given.This version of Batman fails for so many reasons, ridiculously long, bad casting, trying too hard, the score, storyline,l.

"This year would mark the 14th year since The Dark Knight came out. After The Dark Knight made a milestone superhero film, another Batman movie has come out that takes the top place along with The Dark Knight to be the best of the genre. Not only that, but The Batman also transcends the genre following Joker and is a pure neo-noir rather than just a superhero movie. This was one of the finest films I was fortunate enough to experience in the cinemas.One of the first things that impressed me from the beginning was the soundtrack and specifically how it is used. Michael Giacchino has created a deeply moving, sometimes pressure inducing and other times adrenaline rushing soundtrack and the use and integration of the Something in the Way song by Nirvana just makes it all the more atmospheric.The first time we are introduced to Batman through the narration of his journal. It set the tone of the film as well as the confusion and rage of the character. When he says, ""I'm vengeance"" we believe it and that perfectly starts the character arc.Gotham City is as much a character for Batman stories as the titular character himself. Tim Burton movies showed a Gotham that is gothic and a little bit crazy. Nolan tried a bit of something in Batman Begins but decided to play it like any normal city in The Dark Knight. Here Matt Reeves gives life to Gotham as the crime-ridden cesspool it is where criminals grow like mushrooms after rain. The production design by James Chinlund and cinematography by Greig Fraser were on point to make sure the viewers feel immersed in that beautiful cesspool.The way the characters are created and explored, the city and how everything surrounding it exists feels much more realistic and comic-book-like at the same time compared to the Nolan movies. The bat suit looks like something custom made but in secret by a reclusive billionaire, not like the factory model, that is most of the suits yet. And the way the suit performs is also the best yet. Even when in the previous movies people called Batman crazy and freak, he always looked like a superhero. But here, the suit is perfect to call him the freak who dresses as a bat, nonetheless looking badass during the fights. Even the actual suit that is used for the shoot is the most manoeuvrable Batman suit among all the films. The same with the Batmobile. It is not a future-tech armoured vehicle, nor a bat-themed supercar for fun. It looks like a muscle car and comes with enough modifications so that it works the best way Batman needs it to.Being a neo-noir exploring the detective side of Batman, the movie doesn't overindulge in action sequences, but when it does, it delivers. Easily some of the best hand to hand fight sequences in superhero films and even outside them, these were solid. They were just enough to satisfy the audience and make them want more in the next part.These few aspects like the hand to hand fight sequences, the story and the characters being very personal and effective which were missing in the Nolan films, great as they were.Robert Pattinson has proved himself to be a great Batman who is still learning the ropes, which includes not yet learning to be Bruce Wayne. Zoe Kravitz's Selina Kyle was the badass heroine I wished Anne Hathway could have been. The chemistry between the Bat and the Cat was the best I have seen for a couple in a superhero film.I still feel like I'm in Gotham hours after I came out of the theatre.

"2 stars because it wasn't Paul Blart... actually, I might have enjoyed that more. Nodded off multiple times during this bleak and nonsensical effort to make a serious detective Batman movie. In extreme meed of an editor and anyone with a clue about how to maintain a storyline, change the pace occasionally, and create even a single character the viewer can give a damn about. Somehow, despite the inability to do any of the above, they felt their film deserving of nearly 3 hours of viewers' time, millions to make a movie, and the batman franchise. According to reviews here, you'd think people actually like it. Maybe some do, but our entire theater was not exactly buzzing with enthusiasm during and after this relentlessly dark and boring film. The mysteries don't even make sense and are just uncinematic crossword puzzles that get solved before you're even interested in them. The villain, once they pick one... actually they never do, the focus just keeps drunkenly stumbling from one half baked storyline to another... the villains are all boring. The only interesting villain is the one that has about one line and we never see, because the director ruins everything they actually put in screen. I have no idea what anyone sees in this. Every scene the screen is about 90% black and eventually your eyes wear out from exhaustion of seeing the same plodding plot in the same absence of color with the same unlikable protagonist.

No memorable action sequence. Positive for me is the cat woman. She's wonderfully played. Over all it's not a as good as people make out to be. Will watch once and then done with.

"Very dark, very bleak and very long, ""The Batman"" is certainly one gruelling cinematic experience. In a Gotham City which frequently seems to double for New York, although I was thrilled to also identify locations from my hometown of Glasgow, we're thankfully spared the old ""scattered pearls"" origin sequence, as we immediately see, or rather sense the Batman on patrol on of all nights Hallowe'en and of course it's raining bats and dogs too. But as his voiceover tells us, he can't be everywhere at once and while he's taking down some young punks at a subway station, the brutal murder is taking place elsewhere of the city mayor. The killer is the Riddler, but like no Riddler we've ever seen before, no bright green question-marked bodysuit for him, he's clearly a psychotic dressed up like a gimpy slasher.It soon becomes obvious he's on a campaign to clean up the city by ritually slaughtering every top law enforcer on the take and naturally, being Gotham, this means nearly all of them, the Police Commissioner, the D. A. and finally Bruce Wayne himself, our hero targeted for the sins of his father Thomas, who of course died in that Chilly alley years before but apparently was on the dark side too, if I can mix my movie metaphors.From there the plot of characters thickens as we're introduced to James Gordon, who already has a mutual trust and respect with the Batman, Alfred, the Penguin, Catwoman and Carmine Falcone being the most prominent although right at the end, a familiar cackle announces the likely protagonist for the expected sequel.With no time-consuming back-story this time for old Bats, the film still lasts almost three hours and while it has its share of dramatic set-piece scenes such as a high-speed car-chase, a very public gatecrashing of the funeral of a high-ranking city official, the flooding of a political rally and the inevitable extended climax as Batman and Selina (she's never called the Catwoman) not only save their city but also catch up with the Riddler, I just felt that this movie grinded along exceedingly slowly.Robert Pattinson with his weird Emo-haircut, overdoes the intensity and I personally found the narrative difficult to keep up with. Somehow too I was disappointed with the portrayals of Selina Kyle, too young, the Penguin, too peripheral and the Riddler, too unrecognisable (and why the sing-speaking?!), although I did like Jeffrey Webster as the stoic Commissioner.Sure there were some surprising plot twists, such as the reveal about Thomas Wayne's chequered history and also of Selina's father but honestly, I just found this latest return to Gotham almost funereal in its pacing and unremitting in its overhanging pall of ""Se7en""-like gloom, with no points of light or, perish the thought, levity, to brighten the path even a little.Although it had its moments, ""The Batman"" just had too many longeurs for me and could certainly have benefitted from a punchier and less overbearing treatment than it gets here.

"My initial reaction to latest take on Batman was that it was a grubby and pretentious bit of nonsense. But before I gave up on it I read some of the reviews, which lauded the movie for giving Batman more of an investigative role.So I thought, what if I think of this not as a superhero movie but as film noir. And for a little bit, the mood and the approach made sense.But it still didn't work because every time someone did some acrobatic trick or other action-movie gimmick it threw off the film noir sensibility. Unlike Blade Runner, the movie's attempt to span genres caused it to battle itself.The other big issue is the movie is crazy slow. Everything is dragged out with long pauses, sighs, people standing saying nothing (prettily - it's a nice-looking movie). I know director Matt Reeves (who directed the abysmal Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) is going for mood, but come *on.* This movie would probably work better played double speed.What makes this frustrating is that there are some very good things in the film.The acting is excellent. Robert Pattinson's Batman is brooding, obsessive and driven, Zoë Kravitz gives Catwoman a steely toughness, and Jeffrey Wright is grounded and believable.The movie has an interesting low-tech quality compared with the Christopher Nolan take. Batman's costume is black body armor and a hood rather than some crazy futuristic high-tech suit. Catwoman just wears tight leather and a modified ski cap. The Riddler's costume is a makeshift and a bit silly, but the movie fits the riddle thing neatly into its serial-killer-on-the-loose approach.The movie also had a dark take on vigilantism, skating near the edge of ""why doesn't this guy just spend his money to make the city better instead of beat up random bad guys.""That's all interesting, and the last 25 minutes is a genuinely exciting action sequence that still hews to the film's low-tech approach.

"I don't know why I watch these comic book movies anymore. The last one I saw that offered any enjoyment was 8 years ago with Guardians of the Galaxy. Since then I can't remember one from another as they all seem oh so similar. This one I might remember more not because it's so good, but because it's so dark. The cinematography, the atmosphere, the lighting, the plot, the title character. If there were good special effects, I wasn't able to tell. I thought Pattinson was better than some, worse than others in this role. Kravitz does well enough and I did enjoy Dano, an odd, original and very underrated actor. His sweet villain was a surprise and the best thing in the film. As a child I was a comic book fanatic, but I was never really interested in Batman as he had no powers & it made no sense to me. Many, many years later I feel the same, but the number of films made about this dark dude prove me to be in the minority, but seriously folks, this dude should have been dead long ago. My guess is that potential vulnerability is what makes him interesting to many. The Dark Night remains the best thanks to Nolan, Ledger and Bale. This one is never silly like some others, so that is some sort of plus, I assume Pattinson will do another, but you would think this would be one actor to shy from franchises after taking such a long time to shake off the last one and prove he could act, though little required here, but oddly this role never really sticks with any actor at this point in time, perhaps because there have been so many of them by now. And in an era lacking much originality, there will be more since there have only been about a dozen so far.

"I had high expectations going into the movie, but was disappointed in the result. The movie was an hour too long and tried to tell too many story lines. It mixes in references from the Long Halloween with Selena Kyle being Falcones daughter but it should have committed fully to the Long Halloween story.Robert Pattinson is like Val Kilmer as Batman, he's not really good or bad he's just there to fill a suit. While Zoe Kravitz does a good job as cat-woman, is no one going to talk about the fact that she has this bad ass catsuit but just a beanie as a mask? She couldn't just go to Party City and buy a cat mask?The score was the biggest problem in the movie though, with the whole score sounding like the baseline of the Nirvana song ""Something in the Way"" which was also used in the movie. I don't know about you but when I think Batman I don't think Kurt Cobain.There were really heroic Batman scenes too, even in the end where he attacks all the snipers I got nothing out of it because the score just wasn't there. For example the scene in Nolan's Batman Begins where he drives across the bridge to save the day is much more fitting for Batman.Overall, this movie is a jumbled mess that does indubitably feel like it was created by the Riddler.

"Robert Pattinson is great as Batman...I'd say Bruce Wayne as well, except he hardly gets a chance to play the billionaire!

So great.Now for some things I didn't like...the film went on way too long. It could have used a really great editor. It was really dark, I mean visually...I know they do this to make some of the CGI, etc easier (but in this case it just made it easier to take a nap during the film!). It was also too dark emotionally. This was leaking some of the humor in previous Batman films, especially when Bruce Wayne is let out to play. It's like this film decided there is no time for fun or play. The fight scenes went on way too long and weren't very interesting or innovative. Also, this was clearly a big money production, so why couldn't they cover Zoë Kravitz's tattoos better????? And better question still-why did they need to cover them at all? Couldn't Cat Woman reasonably have some tattoos?I would give this a pass unless you are a hardcore superhero fan, a big Robert Pattinson fan, or just can't think of a better way to spend three hours.I think I prefer the Michael Keaton era Batman.",robert pattinson great batman say bruce wayne well except hardly get chance play billionaire dark take batman story really great acting put individual paul dano riddler john turturo carmine falcone favorite part entire film greeting card riddler great thing like film went way long could used really great editor really dark mean visually know make cgi etc easier case made easier take nap film also dark emotionally leaking humor previous batman film especially bruce wayne let play like film decided time fun play fight scene went way long interesting innovative also clearly big money production cover zo kravitz tattoo better better question still need cover cat woman reasonably tattoo would give pas unless hardcore superhero fan big robert pattinson fan think better way spend three hour think prefer michael keaton era batman,positive,343

"Ok, is this as bad as Batman and Robin? No, but is it Oscar material? Very far from it.For the most part the acting wasn't too bad, but several actors didn't fit the roles they were playing. Pattison wasn't right for Batman. Serkis just didn't sell Alfred, though he only had about 3 minutes of screen time to do so (which is a shame as I normally like Andy Serkis in anything). Kravitz was possibly the worst Catwoman I have ever seen (and I saw Halle Berry's attempt).The plot dragged and dragged and just when you thought it was going to pick up it started to drag some more. I think this whole move could have been presented in a 30 minute TV episode after all of Batman's moping scenes were cut out.The score seemed off, particularly with the running Ave Maria theme. It just didn't fit the scenes and I wish Danny Elfman would return.Overall I found the movie to be mildly entertaining.

"To me, this reads as a very stylish fanfic. This is not a very tight script. It's structurally messy, and its ideas are broadly drawn and underdeveloped. As for its tone, well... The movie leans hard into darkness and grittiness, to the point of parody and to the movie's detriment. I found myself snickering at several points where one really shouldn't.Robert Pattinson is severely miscast, as both Bruce Wayne and the Batman. His Bruce is unlikable and unsympathetic, and his Batman is goofy-looking and unconvincing. And sadly, he had absolutely zero chemistry with Zoe Kravitz. Their brief ""romance"", if one could call it that, was soulless.The new Batman theme is just hollow. After spending three hours with those same two notes grating in my ears, I'll be happy to never hear it again.Alfred was a nothing character, the cops were deeply stupid, the voiceovers read like rejected drafts of Rorschach's journal (Watchmen)...
But Paul Dano was good. What little substance there was in this style-fest, he provided. That, and the fact that the visuals were competently crafted, serve to keep my score as high as it is.Make no mistake: this is a mediocre movie masquerading as a much better one.

Probably my main issue with it is that I think of Christopher Nolan's trilogy as the bar for any superhero movie there is while this one is attempting a heavy burden of running with Nolan's legacy in its fanbase's minds - yes, Ben Affleck didn't happen for me - and to be honest everything here pales into comparison. I liked how they tried hard to keep the Batman grounded to a realistic human view of the hero's abilities and resources and that's always a great thing for me personally, I get detached from the story otherwise but I think they overdid it to the exctent it de-glorified Batman, I mean aside from the worse casting, the slow story and the meh production, even the little details like the suit, his ugly shoe are noticeably bad!!

It's not his fault that I didn't find this highly entertaining.First, I think the script is too bland. I can't quite get the supporting roles.

The whole movie it seemed to be raining, I know it was trying to up play Edward Cullens sorrow and depression but it got pretty annoying, just a dark movie. The Batmobile was just a Dodge Hellcat and all of his equipment was pretty outdated and lame. Batman really got lucky in this one, no one out of the many clips of ammo shot at him could seem to hit him in his wildly exposed face and taking a c4 explosion to the face didn't even leave a mark! He got saved several times, he could have died in the wreck chasing the penguin but thankfully he happened to be behind a semi designed to tow cars which happened to align perfect for him to jump the huge wreck he had just caused. You know, it's hard to get past that scene where he chases the penguin down causing a 50 car pile up on the interstate just to find out the penguin had nothing to do with the movie as well. Alfred could have answered most every question he had without needing to go through the first 2 hours of the movie, that was kind of irritating. I couldn't help but notice it sounding like Batman was walking with spurs on the whole movie, it sounded like his boots were full of quarters and they seemed to zoom in on them the whole movie..

"Three tedious boring hours for what amounts to an all-too-typical top down political scandal. It's not that the film is bad, its made quite well. Many of the actors are various levels of good-enough to phenomenal, too. Trouble is most are not given enough to work with to be memorable, especially Paul Dano who gets one big scene to show his crazy reason-behind & it is just a bit flat, although the Oscar caliber actor tries hard to make it memorable... his role amounts to 90% of him masked yelling into a web camera (to me this was a major let down, as one of the best young actors of our time). Surprisingly, I felt like Jim Carrey's over the top Riddler was more fun to hate... here the anonymous killer is less interesting and less enjoyable. This is why The Batman can both be well made and not good, because they've sacrificed entertainment value for grit (as if one can't be without the other), a very heavy modern message about privileged class not being saviors and it replaces a kick-ass action film with one of a lecturing TED Talk. I'm okay with pushing Batman into a modern version of a hero, one which has to talk things out instead of always just fighting, but the film presented has to cover that up with some moments of thrills. It has few and if it were anything other than Batman young people would be bored out of their minds by the morality-by-group-approved-consensus it presents. It's not edgy like a Batman film should be, it's safe and purified in a dull glaze of preachy morality. Why can't people simply trust the Batman just saved them and go on with their day? Why not? Because cops are the defacto bad guys right now in the eyes of many. In the real world, this could make sense... in the fantasy world of Batman he always stood for the thing that was morally higher because he was so selfless.One moment rings especially true when Riddler says ""I may have given you too much credit. You didn't figure it out, did you?"" to a blank stare from Batman that made me laugh out loud. That's exactly what I was thinking, this Batman is kind of a moron compared to the detective skills from Bale or Keaton, never anticipating there could be more to the plan. Here we have a Batman who sits and thinks, investigates & throughout the movie comes up with very little evidence. Beyond solving riddles quickly (which he is great at like always), he really doesn't do much solving of anything (maybe a code or two), preventing of anything except a last minute dive to save the day. Because you just feel bad for all involved in this story you can't really have FUN, which should be the core of any film like this. Even the film Joker, the indie feeling movie with Joaquin Phoenix as equally somber and twisted as this, manages to have moments of sheer glee and celebration of big-entertainment. Joker has some memorable lines, too, some eye catching camera work. Here the film is perfectly well done, but not at all memorable except for what it lacked. You can only call this ""good"" compared to Ben Affleck's Batman that has been so flat for many years (again not the fault of Affleck, the film is just boring and so is this).There are just too many moments I was laughing when it was supposed to be serious, like the hammed up performance by usual Subtle actor Paul Dano who sings Ava Maria as Batman punches the glass for some reason to half-ass get to him. Sure we could talk about how interesting it is that Riddler thinks Batman is on the same side... but I can't focus on that until Dano stops singing Ava Maria and Batman stops punching the glass with no effort whatsoever. What you do in your literal on-screen sequences matter most. Subtext is only important if the audience is first engaged by being entertained.Penguin is reduced to a mobster-clichè joke, about as bland as can be, promising to make his character fleshed out later... but what about now in these three hours? Zoe as Catwoman is the most interesting character, but barely goes through any change after the initial action. And let's talk about action... hardly any until a chase an hour into the film, then one major attempt at the end. Where did they spend $200M here? It's not on screen. The film is constantly talking and taking about doing more talking, with dialogue that often is unintentionally funny or cheesy. The line where Riddler thanks his followers for their tips on explosives, like any YouTuber thanking people for subscribing, got a big laugh from me in a serious moment.The film thematically is of a mix between the Saw films, with grotesque torture (hinted at more than seen but equally disturbing) worse than much of the ""torture-porn"" genre of horror of the 00's (films like Hostel were less disturbing somehow) and a 90's Batman rip-off film such as The Shadow, Dick Tracy, Rocketeer or The Phantom. Like those films, it assumes by moving slower and being less flashy it is classy/smarter. Not necessarily, I say.Instead it takes too long to get to that simple story and doesn't have any flash to get you to those moments any easier. There are no memorable quotable lines like Nicholson in 1989 Batman (Where does he get those fancy Toys?), nor iconic action like in Nolan's films (the semi truck flipping in Dark Knight is more heart pounding than the entirety of this film). It's not really an action film, too severe for a kids film & too boring for a fantasy film. It doesn't have the production design of Burton films, looks good in a general way, but nothing super special. They rightfully got rid of the bat-nipples of the Schumacher years and went more indie than the action packed Nolan films, but what's left is a overly preachy 3 hour film that could have said more in half the time. ""Saw"" sequel ""Spiral"" had essentially the same plot (a killer targeting corrupt city officials/cops) & yet was considered horror and low brow, while this does much of the same and is considered artsy. Go figure.Pattinson does all he can (and I appreciate the emo vibe and painted eyes finally shown after he demasks) but once again there is little room to be unique. Keaton best added himself into this sometimes bland character, since then few have been able. Nobody does badly, it just not special and Batman should be an adventure, not like this.

"I really looked forward to THE BATMAN, hence perhaps my relative disappointment. The visuals are great, but the writing is simply atrocious.To say that the plot is convoluted does not begin to convey my utter confusion - and boredom - watching the confusing investigation. There are way too many characters given pointless roles and background stories relating each and every one in this mess of a plot. What I find especially galling is the way said plot often gets distracted and tries to draw our attention to things that do not actually matter. Sure, I am aware of the gangster drama/neo-noir aspirations of this flick, but any Raymond Chandler makes twice as much sense as this narrative muddle (just ask Lisa Joy and her equally befuddled REMINISCENCE). This kind of writing requires skills that are simply missing here. Selina Kyle as the femme fatale of the piece is the most remarkable failure of the plot - you could simply remove her character and get the exact same narrative. Well, at least Wayne's and Gordon's attempts at deciphering the Riddler's little mysteries gave the audience a good laugh.The worst for me was that I could feel by the end I was supposed to understand that Batman had completed some sort of emotional and moral journey, yet I was unable to properly understand what that was. He was at first obsessed with Vengeance, and by the end he has become a more altruistic person... But there was nothing early on that characterized him as a callous, ungenerous individual, except perhaps his disinterest for his company's philanthropic ventures. In what way has he changed exactly? And did I misunderstand the whole situation or did he actually try to commit suicide to simply change his mind the next moment?

"More than anything, the cinematography is dark which about what you'd expect with modern takes on Batman. But I found it hard to watch. When the lighting wasn't dark or based on a single light source, it was often obscured in some other way including several out of focus takes, or with numerous obstacles blocking the main subject or subjects.It's Batman so the tone of the movie is also dark.

"I was super excited to see this, hypothesizing what kind of mystery riddles the famed riddler came up with. Would it be that the new squeaky clean candidate for mayor has an equally dark past?

Nope... just an internet incel who thinks Batman is working by his side because ""he understands his pain..."" like a bad play on the syndrome saga... also... the big shocker is that the rat...

The actors had some big shoes to fill; may it be just Alfred or Catwoman or Batman himself. Colin Farrell and Zoë Kravitz were perfect; not an inch more or dime less. Just disappeared in their roles. Robert Pattinson's performance was limited to the script. It did not ease; the character felt incomplete, confused, and just gothic-GOTH(look)AM(him).There were no scenes to geeks out about. It was different, but wasn't half bad; the way Batman glides, his fight scenes, the origin story, his identity as Bruce Wayne (although we got very little to see that). One thing the director got it absolutely correct is the Gotham weather! Perpetual rains dampened and lacked sun. A zillion loopholes in the movie most of the time it left like it was just played on a stage; with lamenting and melancholy background music.

"DC has really disappointed this time with the Batman. I remember people being upset about casting Robert Pattinson but I was positive and looking forward to a change. It's not the action but the director and how the movie is made. The Batman from the very beginning is dull and gloomy. I was put to sleep already in the first half of the movie. The movie only picked up I'm the last 30 mins where it ended. Movie making is an art where you have to understand that you need to engage your audience. The interest has to be maintained from the start so they can see the story you're trying to tell. Not sure why DC movies are way too dark. The riddler was phenomenal but the movie was poorly made. Only giving two stars for riddler performance which was shown at the end of the movie. DC please note to make movies that are fast pace, less complicated story wise and take only one villian.

"Modern blockbusters budgets get higher every year, but can the same be said for the viewer's satisfaction? The Batman follows our favorite orphan as his parents are murdered by yet another villain and Bruce Wayne must fend off Gotham's most infamous villains. This film follows the Riddler hunting down the corrupt government as Batman is slowed by many gangsters including Carmine Falcone and the Penguin. However, the one riddle never answered, does The Batman successfully use its massive budget?This movie had large shoes to fill being the first large batman film since the dark knight trilogy, but it still falls harder than when Batman flew off of GCPD. The plot feels more like an anthology series than a movie and with the nearly 3 hour runtime, The Batman deserves an award for somehow still leaving every plot not feeling finished. Every section of the movie feels both drawn out and rushed, and the involvement makes little to no sense. Using the Penguin story arc for example: why has Batman left this clearly criminal hideout untouched for years? Why does he blindly charge into a criminal hideout through the front door? Why doesn't he take in the Penguin right then and there because he clearly has drug or trafficking involvement? All of these lack the proper thinking and mannerisms of a proper protector of Gotham, and even once there is clear evidence, the ONLY TWO proven true pure lawmen leave the Penguin. This isn't how Batman or Gordon have ever behaved, and while I understand wanting to carve a new path in Batman stories, there's a difference between carving a proper story and butchering a story similar to a Victor Zsaz victim. This new batman doesn't always work to save people either. Between the riddle scene in the church, letting Riddler's men shoot each other, and almost beating a man to death before Gordon stops him, this supposedly heroic figure stops being Batman, and starts becoming Badman.Overall, I found myself very disappointed with this film. I was concerned from the first announcement calling it the ""sexiest"" Batman to date, but I didn't expect to feel this movie bomb as hard as Tom Hardy's Bane. This movie is for you if you enjoy slow investigative media such as CSI. For everyone else, don't waste your time like me, sitting waiting for a more iconic villain or classic Batman moments.

"Of all the superheroes, Batman is my favourite. But writers keep insisting in writing dark and uber serious movies about him. Even in a lot of scenes, they are shot dark.

It is that boring.Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne isn't convincing. He looks nothing like a polished billionaire, like Bruce Wayne usually is.Batman's costume does not look high-tech like in previous Batman movies. At close up of his face, you can clearly see that his face mask is put together using stitches. Is it now just make out of leather? Batman has gone low tech. Wayne Enterprises stock must have fallen and Bruce Wayne is cutting cost.I feel they went backwards in this Batman. Perhaps that is the intension of the writers. Bring it back to basics.

"I loved this movie. I thought this was a thrilling and entertaining tribute to Batman and the characters surrounding the franchise.Each actor gives a wonderful performance.Zoe Kravitz in my opinion gave the best performance for Catwoman in my opinion, her dynamic with Robert Pattinson was great and the way she carried herself felt organic compared to lets say Halle Berry or Anne Hathaway.Colin Farrell was perfect for the Penguin, I was sceptical when I first heard about the casting but honestly, really surprised me. He and Batman had the most exciting scene in the film in my opinion.As well Serkis, Wright and others, I thought the cast was great.Of course Robert Pattinson nailed Batman, the way he carried the caped crusader character was perfect and he really felt like a threat.However, my first issue comes from the other side of Robert Pattinsons' role as Bruce Wayne. I feel like when you do a superhero on screen with a secret identity, you should attempt to do 50/50 with the hero and the man behind the mask. This movie felt like 90% Batman and 10% Bruce Wayne.I love Batman but I was reallu hoping to see a new side and personality to Bruce Wayne that we haven't seen before. It felt like we barely saw him.Christian Bale gave a great performance as Bruce Wayne. Although Pattinson was still good in the role, he left a lot to be desired.I also felt the Riddler was somewhat disappointing and I think he could have been way better if they lessened the storyline revolving around Carmine Falcone and just stuck with the Penguin if they wanted to do mob stuff.

"When I found out that Robert Pattinson had been cast as the new Batman..... it just did not feel the right role for him.When I saw the film I found The Batman quite slow moving and the film was too long. And my original concerns about Pattinson being wrongly cast were realised - in my view the only Batman casting that was worse was George Clooney,Whilst I applaud recreating The Batman from a new perspective, it has to be entertaining..... meaning character development, action.

There was way too much talking and explaining everything throughout. The best performance, for me, was from Colin Farell, I didnt even know it was him until I googled it.

"I never thought I'd be bored with a Batman movie but this one was it. Bored with its running time (two and three quarters hours long was an hour too long), bored with the wooden acting, bored with a script full of holes, bored with movies whose only goal is to trash icons.The plot, such as it is, features the Riddler bumping of various city officials to reveal their and the city's corruption while Batman and Lieutenant Gordon trail around after him while at the same time diverting down side plots regarding Batman and Catwoman (neither are called this by the way), Batman and his permanent psychological break and the criminal underbelly of Gotham. How a mistreated/abused orphan (as Riddler is revealed to be) was able to amass his knowledge of corrupt deads, gain amazing technological skills and recruit a jihadist like following ready to die for him is never explained, probably because it can't be, but we do have a monotone narration by Pattinson which rivals Harrison Ford's Blade Runner for worst narration ever.The visualisation of this woeful tale does nothing to lift it. We expect a Batman movie to be dark, both in tone and visuals, but this is pitch black! I don't think there was a single daytime exterior shot and, at best, only a couple of shots in a well lit room, virtually every frame is dark and wet which is not only boring but also makes the whole thing seem to drag along. The tone is equally dark, a grubby tale of corruption and death, revealed by a madman and chased down by a brooding, self loathing goth. The settings are also all over the place, it's meant to be a modern setting (witness the modern cars) but we have references to orphanages full of starving children and overrun with rats (very Victorian), we have gothic Wayne Manor in the middle of the city, we have a police department in 1950's uniforms and we the protagonists vehicles straight out of the 60's.For dark stories to work there needs to be some compelling performances to engage the audience but here we have nothing. In the title role Pattinson is simply wooden, exhibiting no range and looking distinctly uncomfortable; this impacts on his scenes with Jeffrey Wright as Gordon, Zoe Kravitz as 'Catwoman' and Andy Serkis as Alfred, none of these relationships seem real and so as an audience we don't care. These various supporting players plus Colin Farrell as 'Penguin' and John Turturro as Falcone give less than they are capable of; Wright is just walking through adding exposition for the audience in a role where a relationship has been established with the main character but we don't know how or why and at times I don't think Wright did either, Kravitz is an empty vessel, she is neither sexy or alluring and there is definitely no chemistry between her and Pattinson, her reasons for being there are just fan service, Farrell is completely unrecognisable under the heavy makeup and makes no impact, Andy Serkis is completely wasted as Alfred, he has nothing to work with and just seems to have decided to take the money, John Turturro does his best with a limited role and manages to convey the menace and false civility of a career criminal. The best performance is Paul Dano as the Riddler once he is unmasked and the full nature of his madness revealed, the scene in Arkham is excellent.Usually in films of this type the thinness of the characters can be lost in a story that rattles along and a couple of set pieces, this doesn't have that, which only emphasises how bad the characters are. There is only one set piece, the final piece of the Riddler jigsaw which is frankly underwhelming and badly staged. There is an utterly pointless car chase, which starts for no good reason and gets us nowhere at the end, I literally thought someone said ""let's have a car chase"", there is also a chase by what seems like hundreds of police, of Batman through and up the police HQ which is just laughable, I thought it was a Keystone Kops interlude. But also, along the way, are a series of scripting gaffs that never should have happened; Batman turns up to the bust which result in the car chase with no hint of a car but then suddenly there it is, in fight scene in the dark with half a dozen guys firing sub machine guns no one gets hit, not even by a ricochet, the newly elected mayor gets shot but then is seen wading through flood water without a problem, in the farewell scene between Batman and Catwoman, Pattinson walks up to Kravitz at her motorcycle and then when they leave he miraculously has a motorcycle and they race through the streets of an allegedly flooded Gotham which is under martial law and perhaps the best is Riddlers followers who turn up for their moment of destiny when they will shoot down Gothams elites and they come with bolt action rifles and shotguns, remember this is the America where anybody can buy an automatic rifle.I had high hopes for this but was savagely disappointed.",never thought bored batman movie one bored running time two three quarter hour long hour long bored wooden acting bored script full hole bored movie whose goal trash icon plot feature riddler bumping various city official reveal city corruption batman lieutenant gordon trail around time diverting side plot regarding batman catwoman neither called way batman permanent psychological break criminal underbelly gotham mistreated abused orphan riddler revealed able amass knowledge corrupt dead gain amazing technological skill recruit jihadist like following ready die never explained probably monotone narration pattinson rival harrison ford blade runner worst narration ever visualisation woeful tale nothing lift expect batman movie dark tone visuals pitch black think single daytime exterior shot best couple shot well lit room virtually every frame dark wet boring also make whole thing seem drag along tone equally dark grubby tale corruption death revealed madman chased brooding self loathing goth setting also place meant modern setting witness modern car reference orphanage full starving child overrun rat victorian gothic wayne manor middle city police department uniform protagonist vehicle straight dark story work need compelling performance engage audience nothing title role pattinson simply wooden exhibiting range looking distinctly uncomfortable impact scene jeffrey wright gordon zoe kravitz catwoman andy serkis alfred none relationship seem real audience care various supporting player plus colin farrell penguin john turturro falcone give le capable wright walking adding exposition audience role relationship established main character know time think wright either kravitz empty vessel neither sexy alluring definitely chemistry pattinson reason fan service farrell completely unrecognisable heavy makeup make impact andy serkis completely wasted alfred nothing work seems decided take money john turturro best limited role manages convey menace false civility career criminal best performance paul dano riddler unmasked full nature madness revealed scene arkham excellent usually film type thinness character lost story rattle along couple set piece emphasis bad character one set piece final piece riddler jigsaw frankly underwhelming badly staged utterly pointless car chase start good reason get u nowhere end literally thought someone said let car chase also chase seems like hundred police batman police hq laughable thought keystone kops interlude also along way series scripting gaff never happened batman turn bust result car chase hint car suddenly fight scene dark half dozen guy firing sub machine gun one get hit even ricochet newly elected mayor get shot seen wading flood water without problem farewell scene batman catwoman pattinson walk kravitz motorcycle leave miraculously motorcycle race street allegedly flooded gotham martial law perhaps best riddlers follower turn moment destiny shoot gothams elite come bolt action rifle shotgun remember america anybody buy automatic rifle high hope savagely disappointed,negative,395

"All these perfect 10 scores should be a big tell of what kind of movie this is. I mean how could this movie not be a perfect 10 and have a comparison to the likes of apocalypse now or Shawshank redemption?? Give me a break. First off let me say I am a huge Batman fan as far as films and source material. It was one of the first comics I was ever into to. Does that mean I have to objectively lie and say it's great? Nope? Was it? Nope! The story was ok and I was fine with what Matt reeves tried to do but by the end it fell flat. This movie was horribly miscast. I mean so many key characters were just not believable in their roles. Robert Pattinson is just getting rave reviews as Batman. He really wasn't good. I actually like him as an actor but him as the bat just seemed like it was like the dude from twilight he played and I would know my girlfriend at the time dragged me to every time one of them came out. Andy Serkies another actor who I usually love in everything was ridiculously miscast as Alfred. At no point could I see him as Alfred and I usually think that he could play anything. Not everyone was bad. Dano as usual when his in something was excellent as the new take on the riddler. Once his mask is finally gone and you can see those bug eyes of his you actually believe he is a crazy zodiac like killer that lost his marbles long ago. Zoe Kravitz I just don't like so I would say I was biased gong into the film on her last night. But I thought she was a waste of a catwoman. The best part of the movie and with the shortest screen time was Colin Farrell! He was the one I was worried about the most and he was amazing. I heard he's getting a spin-off show or movie on HBO and that's definitely something I would watch. I appreciate a director and writer trying to take a different attempt to make something fresh especially something that has been done as much as Batman. And I love films like LA confidential which this movie obviously took a lot of influence from, but refused less of your fanboy status this movie just wasn't that
good. The sound mixing on it was absolutely terrible! The back ground noise was loud and surround and when the batmobile first fires up you feel it but anytime someone speaks it sounds like their voices are muted or like when your headphones are in transparency mode and voices break though is the best example I could come up with. I thought maybe it's the theater I'm in so I went to pee cause it's 3hrs and while I was out I stuck my head into one of AMC prime theaters next door and the same thing. 3 hours of whispering is horrible and really takes you out of the movie. It wasn't just the voices. When a flurry of punches happened you could barely hear them but the music was louder than ever. Bring on the downvotes fanboys I'm waiting. But we all know this movie was far from a perfect 10. Very few movies are 10's but you guys will give those double digits out like nothing anyways. That being said is it a 1 which seems to be a common theme or the worst movie this year. Nope. It's a 4/5 realistically I went lower because of all the fake 10's.",perfect score big tell kind movie mean could movie perfect comparison like apocalypse shawshank redemption give break first let say huge batman fan far film source material one first comic ever mean objectively lie say great nope nope story ok fine matt reef tried end fell flat movie horribly miscast mean many key character believable role robert pattinson getting rave review batman really good actually like actor bat seemed like like dude twilight played would know girlfriend time dragged every time one came andy serkies another actor usually love everything ridiculously miscast alfred point could see alfred usually think could play anything everyone bad dano usual something excellent new take riddler mask finally gone see bug eye actually believe crazy zodiac like killer lost marble long ago zoe kravitz like would say biased gong film last night thought waste catwoman best part movie shortest screen time colin farrell one worried amazing heard getting spin show movie hbo definitely something would watch appreciate director writer trying take different attempt make something fresh especially something done much batman love film like la confidential movie obviously took lot influence refused le fanboy status movie good sound mixing absolutely terrible back ground noise loud surround batmobile first fire feel anytime someone speaks sound like voice muted like headphone transparency mode voice break though best example could come thought maybe theater went pee cause hr stuck head one amc prime theater next door thing hour whispering horrible really take movie voice flurry punch happened could barely hear music louder ever bring downvotes fanboys waiting know movie far perfect movie guy give double digit like nothing anyways said seems common theme worst movie year nope realistically went lower fake,positive,417
"Funny how the Batman movies made 30 years ago seem more professional and better made than this one. Heck, even Joel Schumacher's abomination was at least visually engaging--more than can be said for this Gen why-bother version. This Bruce Wayne is a broody, mopey sad-sack, and the other characters are even less interesting. It's hard to even tell them apart because all their voices sound the same. The murder at the beginning is hard to even make out what is going on. And the Batmobile looks like a reject from one of the old Mad Max movies (or maybe Fast&Furious?). I'm sure this cost a lot to make, but I have to rank it as an mediocre, lack-luster failure.",funny batman movie made year ago seem professional better made one heck even joel schumacher abomination least visually engaging said gen bother version bruce wayne broody mopey sad sack character even le interesting hard even tell apart voice sound murder beginning hard even make going batmobile look like reject one old mad max movie maybe fast furious sure cost lot make rank mediocre lack luster failure,negative,418

Glad I didn't pay to see this movie as I caught it streaming on HBO Max. I wasn't bothered by the violence in the beginning but as the film progressed it made little sense. The most glaring mistake was Pattinson as Bruce Wayne. Ok when he was Batman but why would a billionaire have greasy long hair covering his face. Made him look like a derelict.

"Sitting in the theater before the movie, I noticed a few parents bringing along their young children, the whole family decked out in Batman attire and the kids obviously anxious to see the iconic superhero on the big screen. It brought me back to my own childhood, of my dad taking me to see the original Tim Burton Batman in the movie theater and in the process creating a lifelong fan. But after Matt Reeve's 'The Batman' had finished, I again thought about those children and honestly felt a little sorry for them. Not for any of the adult themes present or because the movie is too violent or scary (although that may be a concern of some parents), but because I couldn't imagine the children not being absolutely bored stiff through most of this glum, pretentious, dialogue heavy procedural.There are promising elements here: the film looks gorgeous, and the filmmakers have done a great job in creating a gothic, foreboding, stylized Gotham. Fight scenes are gritty and hard-hitting, the one car chase is a lot of fun, and it definitely takes the source material seriously. But overall this movie feels a lot like a pale imitation of films like Se7en or Zodiac. It is nowhere near as dark or horrifying as its trying to be, and it doesn't have the supreme pacing or execution in crafting a chilling and ominous mystery and tale of obsession like those obvious influences. The narrative and overall puzzle of the story is decent but never entirely gripping enough to justify its run time; a lot of hushed, murmured exchanges that make for long, dull stretches; the mysteries and ties between the Wayne family and mob boss Carmine Falcone that drive the plot are frankly contrived; the gestation of Paul Dano's Riddler and his ultimate scheme a little too heavy handed.Plus, I'm not a fan of Pattinson's Bruce Wayne. I've never seen the Twilight Saga, and really enjoy Pattison's work in other films I've seen him in like Tenet and Good Time, so I have no biases against the actor. But this portrayal conjures up every characterization I've heard about him as Edward Cullen: totally over-the-top in his brooding, moody, and burdened mannerisms. Not that I am against a different conception of Bruce Wayne than we've seen before, and would welcome a well executed portrayal of a bit of a withdrawn, emotionally damaged individual. I just found Pattison's sulkiness a little silly.At least Matt Reeves is aiming high here and attempting to put his own stamp on this material, so I will give him credit for that. And I will say I'm curious to see what comes next for this iteration.",sitting theater movie noticed parent bringing along young child whole family decked batman attire kid obviously anxious see iconic superhero big screen brought back childhood dad taking see original tim burton batman movie theater process creating lifelong fan matt reeve batman finished thought child honestly felt little sorry adult theme present movie violent scary although may concern parent imagine child absolutely bored stiff glum pretentious dialogue heavy procedural promising element film look gorgeous filmmaker done great job creating gothic foreboding stylized gotham fight scene gritty hard hitting one car chase lot fun definitely take source material seriously overall movie feel lot like pale imitation film like se en zodiac nowhere near dark horrifying trying supreme pacing execution crafting chilling ominous mystery tale obsession like obvious influence narrative overall puzzle story decent never entirely gripping enough justify run time lot hushed murmured exchange make long dull stretch mystery tie wayne family mob bos carmine falcone drive plot frankly contrived gestation paul dano riddler ultimate scheme little heavy handed plus fan pattinson bruce wayne never seen twilight saga really enjoy pattison work film seen like tenet good time bias actor portrayal conjures every characterization heard edward cullen totally top brooding moody burdened mannerism different conception bruce wayne seen would welcome well executed portrayal bit withdrawn emotionally damaged individual found pattison sulkiness little silly least matt reef aiming high attempting put stamp material give credit say curious see come next iteration,negative,424

"I'll start by saying the movie is way too long, unecessarely long (by 1h at least).

Remember when you feel every punch the Batman throws in the other movies when they hit a bad guy? U dont have that here, its simple punches and kicks. Oh he does have his ass kicked a lot, by simple thugs lol I guess he forgot some of the learned techniques from League Of Shadows along the depression.The detective Work is boring and unispiring, Batman feels like he's constantly on drugs (Xanax or something) he's always slow talking, slow in movements and those stares... they overdid those for sure. Penguin and Catwoman cast are decent but story wise nothing special.I think they kinda overdid the Riddler a bit and I think he tries too hard, but no facial expressions along the movie kinda ruin the character charisma, but thats how it is.Oh and dont forget about your galoches and rubber boat, does it rain in the gotham!

"I thought Robert Pattinson did well and was fully believable as The Batman, his slacker alter ego was a bit of a chore and I longed for Jeremy Irons' Alfred who would give him the much needed kick up the backside. As it was we got a rather flat Andy Serkis who was okay but, like much of the cast, didn't really have any lines or character to make him memorable.Jeffrey Wright was back as Felix Leiter, erm, I mean James Gordon and ZoÃ« Kravitz was fine in the part but didn't really seem to have any chemistry with Robert Pattinson. The villain just comes across as a bit meh.The film has a nice look to it, dark though it was, a curious mix of 80s retro and today with taxis from forty years ago mixed in with all the modern tech and the rain and more rain.On one hand it has its gritty realism but every so often you get a blast of comic book style physics where something happens or someone survives something that never would actual happen, with actual gravity and physics. This happens so seldom that it seems to not fit with the rest of the film.What got me most though was how jarring some of the cuts were, and how rushed some of the scenes felt, this in a three hour film with a very simple plot. To go from a scene wherein someone is near killed to the next scene with them, half an hour later when all is fine and everyone is A-okay.Or to have someone wake up from a comma, fully lucid who can jump into a five minute argument about ethics. Its just odd, jarring and feels a bit silly.At times it felt more like a TV show than a film and I would say that was down to the mediocre script being delivered by a largely forgeable cast. None of the supporting characters have any interesting dialogue or real character development AT ALL.I do wonder if the length had been cut down to 90 or 100 minutes if the film would've had enough pace to it to hide a lot of the faults, as it is you have a lot of time to ponder as it plods along.

"While I can get behind a new take to the Batman franchise, I felt this was a take from someone who didn't understand Batman. Sure it had detective like quality in the story, and the acting was on par (despite race-swaps and a off brand comment). However it was the seeing Batman as morose and brooding, even as the esteemed Bruce Wayne. While the story and the cinematography are good, acting is good, it fails to be a true sense of Bruce/Batman in the ways that he should've been.Even the choreography was good, but to live up to the Bat I think it had too much light, some plot holes that didn't make sense, and a few nonsensical bits. I feel while the major elements of the movie held together better than anticipated it still fell flat in ways because of the lack of those true Batman characteristics. Bruce was not dumb about how he did things. I felt that Robert did a fine job in acting but he really didn't hit the mark because the director/writers decided to go a weaker Batman in comparisons to the actual character.In other words this seems like it could've been any ""vigilante"" movie, but was plugged in to the Batman simply to drive up sales. Many of the characters didn't resemble their personas from the comics, and while I again understand this is a different take on the series, it doesn't work for me as a whole.

"Title. I was surprised to find that Pattison actually can be a convincing Batman. The problem is the script.The Riddler was the textbook definition of an incel.Batman less cared about crime and mostly just wanted to put 'bad guys' in the hospital.The final 'dramatic' fight scene, at the end of the movie, was a bunch of Riddler copying incels fighting Batman with textbook bolt action hunting rifles (including the scope). If that wasn't enough, they even did the trope where the bad guys run up to the good guys into punching range and don't even attempt to actually use the guns.There was a lot of things wrong with this movie.

"The Batman is a gripping, gorgeous, and, at times, genuinely scary psychological crime thriller that gives Bruce Wayne the grounded detective story he deserves. Robert Pattinson is great as a very broken Batman, but it's Zoe Kravitz and Paul Dano who steal the show, with a movingly layered Selina Kyle/Catwoman and a terrifyingly unhinged Riddler. Writer/director Matt Reeves managed to make a Batman movie that's entirely different from the others in the live-action canon, yet surprisingly loyal to Gotham lore as a whole.

"There's a good film hidden between what is nothing but self-indulgent filler. Unfortunately, the filler makes up at least 3/5 of the run time.I'm curious in the director's insistence he wanted to create a ""realistic"" version of Batman rather than a superhero. I think to achieve that, you'd need to at least imply your hero is somewhat hurt or even out of breath after taking on a gang of gun wielding thugs. I'd assume actually showing blood when someone is having their skull caved in would help too. You also need to show emotion of some sort. The only actor who shows a modicum of range here is Paul Dano, which is why it's a 4 rather than a 1 from me.What we ended up with was a Wish version of Se7en mixed with Blade Runner's disastrous narration.",good film hidden nothing self indulgent filler unfortunately filler make least run time curious director insistence wanted create realistic version batman rather superhero think achieve need least imply hero somewhat hurt even breath taking gang gun wielding thug assume actually showing blood someone skull caved would help also need show emotion sort actor show modicum range paul dano rather ended wish version se en mixed blade runner disastrous narration,negative,450
"Matt Reeves' new Batman with a splendid Robert Pattinson is terribly bloated running at 3 hours, but this is a smart detective film where the Dark Knight meets Zodiac, Seven and Saw. This action-filled movie is dark, relentless and riveting, but it come anywhere near Christopher Nolan's talents for The Dark Knight movies and leads with a gritty tone through a mystery.The Batman centres on a surprisingly compelling storyline revolving around a sadistic killer known as the Riddler leaves behind a trail of cryptic clues notably for the Batman. This engrossing action movie is executed with a very tense and rough tone that's influenced by and gives you Zodiac vibes through the Riddler, Seven vibes through the gritty detective mystery and even some Saw vibes through the Riddler's creativity and traps.Looking at the fact that this film runs at an extremely lengthy runtime of almost 3 hours, it obviously could've been a whole lot quicker, but it's the kind of film that's extremely difficult and requires a lot of patience to get into. Robert Pattinson is a superb choice for Batman, Colin Farrell is completely unrecognisable and the Riddler played by Paul Dano is excellent. This is definitely a movie you wanna get some popcorn and go to the cinemas for.Another big thing about this Batman instalment is how excellent the cinematography is and how well-designed its big and small details are. There's fantastic action fistfights and gun flashes, and director Reeves knows how to shoot it in a way that'll appeal many just for the unforgettable action. On the other hand is unfortunately some unexciting dialogue through uninteresting characters.

"The Riddler (Paul Dano) has a huge grudge against The Batman/Bruce Wayne (Pattinson) stemming from the time Bruce Wayne's father was accused of having someone killed back in the day. Also Batman and Police Commissioner Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) investigate the murder of a Prominent District Attorney and learn about wide spread corruption within the Police Dept.This Batman movie is not as good as all the other Batman movies. Reasons: it's too long, mostly too dark in just about every scene and the characters mumble their lines or talk so low we cannot follow what was being said. Because of these reasons, this was very hard to follow. The acting by all and story lines were fine, but when you cannot follow what is being said in these darkened scenes, what's the point? Someone forgot there was an audience out here.The chase scene with Batman and the Penguin (Oswald Cobblepot) was a complete disaster. It was just a lot of noise, colors just like a video game rushing by us for too long a time. It was hard to see who was chasing who.Oswald Cobblepot as the Penguin stood out as he tries to state his case to Batman and Gordon that he knew nothing about the DA being murdered. Also Zoe Kravitz as Selina, the Cat Woman was very good as she tries to find out what happened to her friend Annika who ended up dead.The credits had Colin Farrell as Oz in here, but I have no idea where he was in the story as I never saw him or even heard the name OZ mentioned. Hope he got paid.Notables: John Turturro as Carmine Falcone, a night club owner who claimed the entire police dept worked for him; Peter Sarsgaard as DA Colson who had a bomb strapped to him; Andy Serkis as Alfred, Bruce Wayne's Butler.Of course, I will watch any new Batman movie good or bad because I am a Batman fan and hope it will be better than this one.

"Prepare yourself for a different kind of Caped Crusader in ""The Batman"" as a ripped Robert Pattinson dons the cape and cowl. A grave looking Bruce Wayne wonders after two years of crime fighting if he is making a difference. Pattinson's version of Bruce Wayne may be the youngest iteration of The Batman. In fact, he refers to himself as 'Vengeance' rather than Batman and spends more time on crime than climbing the social ladder. Get ready for some heavyweight drama, too. ""Cloverfield"" writer & director Matt Reeves and ""Hunger Games"" co-scripter Peter Craig put Pattinson through the wringer in what amounts to a ""Mad Max"" spin on the Detective Comics hero. Awash in shadowy 1940s film noir lighting, nothing about ""The Batman"" is either lighthearted or romantic. Gotham City is a sinister Sodom and Gomorrah on the eve of a critical mayoral election. This grim murder mystery about byzantine corruption in both the police department and the district attorney's office has a sliver of the sadistic ""Saw"" franchise in its DNA. A nonentity who calls himself 'the Riddler' wants to wash away all that evil with some Old Testament retribution. Meantime, The Batman encounters slinky Selina Kyle, (ZoÃ« Kravitz of ""X-Men: First Class""), aka Catwoman, who is searching for a friend gone missing. Predictably, the Bat and the Cat team up for different reasons to contend with a hazmat clad Riddler who looks nothing like the spandex-clad Jim Carrey in ""Batman Forever"" (1995). Watching this grim, serious-minded melodrama, you'll feel like you're caught in a storm without an umbrella because ""The Batman"" is dark, rainy and ominous. Basically, you'd need a hacksaw to carve the doom-laden atmosphere, especially when it clocks in at 176 marathon minutes. Reeves deliberately takes his time piecing together each part of the puzzling plot without giving away anything. Oscar-winning ""Up"" composer Michael Giacchino's orchestral score heightens both the suspense and sharpens the chills with a variety of musical cues.""The Batman"" feels more like David Fincher's serial killer thriller ""Se7en"" (1995), co-starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, than a luminescent, lightweight, costume-clad crimefighting caper. Mind you, nobody has solved the murders of Thomas and Martha Wayne twenty years before, and the tragedy still clouds Bruce Wayne's psyche. We see this younger version of Bruce suited up more often as The Batman rather than modeling the latest sartorial fashions with a gold digger hanging onto his elbow. Crime preoccupies The Batman, and he has trouble keeping out of trouble with the Gotham City Police. Although he has won the trust and support of Detective Lieutenant James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright of ""No Time to Die""), most of Gordon's skeptical superiors and subordinates regard the Caped Crusader with considerable suspicion. Mind you, the criminal element have even less use for him. Blue collar crooks cringe when the Bat signal illuminates the skies. Mob boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro of ""The Big Lebowski"") and the Penguin, Oswald Cobblepot (an unrecognizable Colin Farrell of ""Daredevil"") dismiss The Batman as a rank amateur. Carmine knew Bruce Wayne when the latter was a child, but he doesn't suspect the orphaned Wayne is The Batman. Neither does Carmine take Selina Kyle seriously either. Actually, she serves drinks in the Penguin's shady nightclub that serves as a front for Carmine's minions. Rarely do we see The Riddler (a bespectacled Paul Dano of ""Swiss Army Man"") until the last half hour. He doesn't appear very intimidating and that makes him seem twice as intimidating. The Riddler's riddles aren't bright and witty, but dark and dangerous. He has orchestrated a massive maneuver that makes the January 6th riot at the Capitol in Washington, D. C. look like child's play. The huge difference here is writer & director Matt Reeves makes everything appear both plausible and chilling in its audacity. No, extraterrestrials don't enter the fray like in ""Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016) or either version of ""Justice League"" (2017).""The Batman"" begins as a slow burn whodunit as our protagonist assembles clues, but there is no shortage of action. This Batman isn't afraid to tango even when the opposition outnumber him. The harrowing demolition derby freeway chase through Gotham City with The Batman hauling butt after the Penguin is a genuine showstopper. The new, stripped-down, Batmobile muscle car looks nothing like any earlier incarnations of the renowned vehicle. Indeed, this Batmobile has a predatory appearance. Interestingly enough, The Batman relies on his trusty Bat motorcycle to zip from here to there with his cape fluttering in the breeze. Reeves doesn't dwell on many Batman gadgets like a James Bond thriller. While Reeves and Craig are more focused on narrative realism, they equip our hero with some clever gadgets. For example, the smart contact lenses with built-in cameras that recognize and identify people are extraordinary. Occasionally, things don't always work out as smoothly for our hero as he expects them. The scene where The Batman BASE jumps from a skyscraper at night to elude capture goes awry when he deploys his parachute too early. Reeves and Craig surround Pattinson with a sterling cast of infamous characters, and they put the Caped Crusader into some predicaments he cannot get out of even with his gadgetry. Unlike previous incarnations of Batman, Pattinson will have the chance to age in the role, because Warner Brothers has signed him up for a trilogy. He has the tenacity of Michael Keaton's Batman, the guile of Christian Bale's Batman, but he lacks the brawn of Ben Affleck's Batman. Nevertheless, in his freshman outing, Pattinson looks like he has gotten off on the right foot.

"The Good- The intro to the film was incredible. Cinematography and color scheme is great. They bring a lot of character to Gotham. The batsuit is the best and really fits Pattinson perfectly. The Batmobile design was incredible. Colin Farrell and Zoe Kravitz played their roles really well and the detective angle was pretty good while it lasted.The bad-
1) The film is based on a wrong premise. Batman and everyone else keep on calling him vengeance. Nothing in the film indicated that. He just does standard vigilante a$$ kicking with his fists throughout the film, nothing that indicates he is vengeful. Batman begins and dark knight and even Batfleck had brutal moments that could be considered vengeful but this had none of that. He even doesn't let catwoman get revenge on Falcone, yet they keep on repeating this theme just to justify the ending.2) The story focuses on batman and is mostly filmed with batman in frame, yet the characters that we are expected to care for were hardly present for more than 2 minutes in the film (Talking about Annika). It was clear she was dead right from the beginning and halfway through the film we are expected to care for her again and they get Falcone based on that and not all the other stuff he previously did?3) The way the film starts, it is established that batman has done nothing to reduce crime the past two years. In such a world Gordon who is oblivious to the corruption in the police force has no reasons to be trusting or an ally to the batman and the reason for doing so has not been addressed and is quite essential when you are building this new batman world.4) The Wayne's were made hinted as bad guys by riddler only to be contradicted by Falcone and then by Alfred in a matter of 10 minutes and that plotline was completely abandoned for Annika
5) Catwoman is just randomly brought back at the Gotham square garden as if they just remembered is in the filmThe terrible-
1) The amount of incompetence of the characters. Gordan is the most incompetent he's ever been. All he did in the film was read out riddles and just act surprised to the killings. Couldn't even protect the mayor elect properly. He just leaves penguin despite of him being involved at a drug exchange which was followed by a shootout and then a dangerous road chase where people certainly died coz of him. The cop who works for Falcone is a bad cop and even worse henchman. Couldn't even dispose Annika's body and catwoman's phone and brought her at the drug exchange for catwoman to conveniently find out.2) Riddler was horribly written. He clearly believed in what he was doing in exposing the corruption and the mob, and this was suppose to be a good lesson learned for the batman where he understands a way to go about change is to go after real bad guys like falcone and not petty criminals. Instead they shoehorned the idea of batman being vengeance as the problem.3) Batman says he learnt from his mistakes, cannot be vengeance anymore. So what are you gonna do as batman if not beat up bad guys? Rescue kittens from trees? He was suppose to do that as Bruce Wayne instead we have a Bruce Wayne who is not just recluse but looks overtly sad in public and gave me no indication that he is vengeful, just sad.4) The interrogating scene was TERRIBLE. It ruined a potentially good villain. Batman villains are crazy, but they are competent which is what makes them interesting. Making him an online incel and getting himself arrested with no contingency plan to fulfill this weird infatuation he has with the Bat was a bizarre way to end his arc and made him look incredibly stupid and wiped out his threatening aura instantly.5) Batman probably did more damage to the people in the garden by blowing off the glass roof than the fake riddlers did lol. There were no stakes in the final battle whatsoever. Those guys were after one mayor elect who barely got 2 minutes of screen-time before that and is just the most standard ""Hey look here's a good guy"" character I have ever seen. Moreover the flooding was just a cool moment they decided to give the riddler and was completely unnecessary.6) The last 40 minutes are sooo drawn out with unnecessary scenes like the joker riddler scene at arkham and the camera taking forever to show bat and the cat partning ways.7) Instead if using actions to make it look creepy they overly rely on overacting with over the top inflections in riddler's voice, slow dialogues and creepy music.",good intro film incredible cinematography color scheme great bring lot character gotham batsuit best really fit pattinson perfectly batmobile design incredible colin farrell zoe kravitz played role really well detective angle pretty good lasted bad film based wrong premise batman everyone else keep calling vengeance nothing film indicated standard vigilante kicking fist throughout film nothing indicates vengeful batman begin dark knight even batfleck brutal moment could considered vengeful none even let catwoman get revenge falcone yet keep repeating theme justify ending story focus batman mostly filmed batman frame yet character expected care hardly present minute film talking annika clear dead right beginning halfway film expected care get falcone based stuff previously way film start established batman done nothing reduce crime past two year world gordon oblivious corruption police force reason trusting ally batman reason addressed quite essential building new batman world wayne made hinted bad guy riddler contradicted falcone alfred matter minute plotline completely abandoned annika catwoman randomly brought back gotham square garden remembered filmthe terrible amount incompetence character gordan incompetent ever film read riddle act surprised killing even protect mayor elect properly leaf penguin despite involved drug exchange followed shootout dangerous road chase people certainly died coz cop work falcone bad cop even worse henchman even dispose annika body catwoman phone brought drug exchange catwoman conveniently find riddler horribly written clearly believed exposing corruption mob suppose good lesson learned batman understands way go change go real bad guy like falcone petty criminal instead shoehorned idea batman vengeance problem batman say learnt mistake cannot vengeance anymore gonna batman beat bad guy rescue kitten tree suppose bruce wayne instead bruce wayne recluse look overtly sad public gave indication vengeful sad interrogating scene terrible ruined potentially good villain batman villain crazy competent make interesting making online incel getting arrested contingency plan fulfill weird infatuation bat bizarre way end arc made look incredibly stupid wiped threatening aura instantly batman probably damage people garden blowing glass roof fake riddlers lol stake final battle whatsoever guy one mayor elect barely got minute screen time standard hey look good guy character ever seen moreover flooding cool moment decided give riddler completely unnecessary last minute sooo drawn unnecessary scene like joker riddler scene arkham camera taking forever show bat cat partning way instead using action make look creepy overly rely overacting top inflection riddler voice slow dialogue creepy music,negative,461

"""The Batman"" is a new 2022 film and, as you can already guess from its title, it has the potential to be perhaps the biggest blockbuster of the year and also lead the box office at the end of 2022. We will see about that. Let's look at the now as of now, the quality that is. First of all, we focus on the basics though: The director and one of the writers too is Matt Reeves. He is mostly known so far for the recent Planet of the Apes films and as he joins filmmakers like Nolan and Burton when it comes to Batman, it is quite a challenging task of course. With the screenplay he got help from Peter Craig. Not a big name by any means, but he worked on The Hunger Games franchise in the past, so he is also not new on the subject of huge big-budget films either just like his director. I find his inclusion on The Town more memorable though. Their film here runs for a massive three hours almost, so once again longer than what Burton and Nolan did. And their films also weren't short at all either. Overall, as you can see from my rating, I enjoyed the watch, but was not stunned or anything. I think they could have taken more risks here and there. It is a solid film from beginning to end where I was curious about what would happen next, but I was never blown away once. Not a single scene where this film truly stunned me, so the heights are certainly not as high as they were with some other Batman films from recent years. Or decades I could almost say now pretty much. I will get into detail there later on. Let's look at the cast now. Definitely not a bad year for the former Twilight stars. Stewart scored her first Oscar nomination and Pattinson launches this massive franchise we got here. He is equally dark and gloomy as Bale, but also somewhat different from other perspectives. Definitely more of a boy than a man, but that also has to do with the age. Here and there, he almost looked a bit like an emo kid. Then again, we do not see a lot from him without the costume. Definitely not as much as I expected. The vast majority of scenes show him as Batman.As for the supporting cast, you can really see the diversity everywhere. Kravitz did not win me over as Catwoman, even if The Bat and the Cat definitely has a ring to it. I give her that. Wright was okay. Interesting how he now moved on from being Bond's buddy to being Batman's only friend in the police force. These moments when Batman was somewhat discriminated against by the police officers were also the only moments when this film was slightly funny. Like not really with the bitter guy who calls him a freak, but instead with the one who references to chain of evidence. So yeah, this is not a film where you will laugh at all. But it does not have to be in order to succeed. I was actually baffled to read that Colin Farrell was the Penguin here. Unrecognizable with the makeup and I wonder if this alone can bring the film an Oscar nomination for makeup in 2023. Kinda doubt it, but we will see. John Turturro is always a welcome addition. I like the actor a lot. And he really made the most of his highly unlikable character. Paul Dano I was curious about as I really love There Will Be Blood, but sadly his screen time here is very limited and you also hardly see him without a mask on his face. Andy Serkis I cannot stand at all. Not gonna lie. Does nothing for me as an actor and his many political references in real life are not helping either because I think politics should be kept out of the entertainment industry as much as possible. He's (if at all) a good special effects actor to me, nothing more, and that's why I wanted Alfred to die when the bomb went off. Sadly, he recovered. Again, no courage. What a step back from Michael Caine to this. Peter Sarsgaard I immediately recognized, but I simply could not come up with the name. He was fine too. Gone quickly here, so no massive Two-Face story in this franchise, even if his corruption also kinda fit the idea behind Two-Face already. At the end, there was a bit of an epilogue that showed us the Joker, who will maybe be the key antagonist in the sequel which will 100% get made. No offence to Barry Keoghan who has great recognition value too, but the footsteps of Nicholson and Ledger are gigantic. Let's ignore Leto for a moment.So yeah, I already mentioned the political correctness. It felt a bit too much honestly. Like the scene when the Asian guy is attacked and Batman comes to help him, they had a Black kid there which was about to become part of the gang, but they show us he is not as violent and ruthless as the others. Black Catwoman, Black Gordon and the woman who becomes the new mayor as well. I thought early on that she could be more of an antagonist with what she said about Batman, but nope, she is also one of the good guys. Just made sure they avoid all race-related criticism whatsoever. I am all for good actors getting good roles regardless of their ethnicty, but sometimes it feels as if there is too much focus on that. At least it looked like Catwoman is out for the sequel, which is probably a good thing because the character was not half as interesting as it could have been. 100% Team Hathaway there. Overall, I felt like Reeves played it too safe here. He did not have to go for many risks to make sure this will be seen (and liked) by millions and millions, so he took this route, but sacrificed individual creativity for it. Just take the flood at the end. Interesting inclusion, but how they used it felt so ineffective. It was supposed to deliver great tension, but the end is Batman just walks through the water and helps save the people and now they appreciate him a bit more as a samaritan. One of the moments I liked more was again the scene with the Asian victim. This man's reaction was a good example of how everybody saw Batman at that point. Even if he came to their rescue, they were still incredibly scared and he begged Batman afterwards to not hurt him.The Riddler was the main antagonist yep and honestly he looked a bit like Bane with his mask most of all, but also with the way he was breathing loudly. Is wheezing the right word? You know what I mean anyway. I mean this take could not have been any more different than the way Carrey portrayed him around 30 years ago. There you also see the massive difference in terms of comedy and drama between these films. The riddles were okay. Maybe a bit difficult to believe how quickly Batman solved them all. Also how they realized it was not in the Spanish language, but a web address was also meh. Not as smart as they wanted it to be, but yeah the Penguin's (here fully human) moment when he swears after they leave him behind was another rare funny inclusion. As for the Riddler, the idea that he planned it all and knew he would be in jail in the end was too much. In Arkham I should say. I mean I understand that he thought he had finished his destructive masterpiece at that point, but come on. He can also watch and admire it all from outside jail. The inclusion of his helpers that he recruited online was also a bit absurd to be honest. The vengeance element was good, also Batman's words and also he found the boy early on, but his transformation near the end and how he realizes that vengeance was actually not good did feel a bit scripted. The farewell to Catwoman was a bit cringeworthy too with how she said something like who is she kidding and that he is already taken. They tried some epic moments here and there, but they rarely made an impact. The audio tape with the killing was more effective, but maybe I simply liked these scenes more because of Turturro. The story with Batman's father's potential corruption I also enjoyed because of him maybe.They sure fit a lot in these under three hours story-wise, but still it did not feel bloated, which is definitely a success. Also many characters. I mean look at how the Penguin had his own film with Burton and so did the Riddler. They were clearly going for the antagonists not used by Nolan. Except the Joker of course if he is really at the center of it all in the next one. What else can I say? I think this film went by really quickly and my attention was caught from beginning to end, so a success for sure with this duration, even if I did not witness much greatness here. Definitely room for improvement. Dano had some solid moments of acting really crazy and letting it all out towards the end, which was nice to see, especially given the fact they hardly used him in the first two hours. The moment when we think he knows Batman's identity, but actually doesn't was also among the more memorable. Just like the explanation that it does not matter who's behind the mask because the mask is their actual self. This was witty and creative and meaningful at the same time, so I can also say that thanks to such moments I never doubted at all that I could give this film a positive recommendation. Which I hereby do. It's just not a very enthusiastic one. A lot was done right here, much more than done wrong and these weaker parts like how Selina of course has to save Batman's life on one occasion near the end are easy to forget. The story with her sister (except the actual tape) was also something I could have done without and the film could have run for only 2.5 hours this way for example. Oh yeah, give us more Batmobile please next time, not necessarily more technical stuff in general. Those lenses were quite nice. Seeing this film was worth it and no matter if you know all or nothing about Batman, you will still be surprised here and there. Like I thought that maybe the guy who is killed early on could be Bruce Wayne's father. There they were also toying with us how he ""kills"" the kids. Then turns out to be the actual victim. That's all. Go watch, preferrably at the movie theater, but seeing it once is surely enough. Better give one of the superior older Batman films a rewatch instead. I hope the second can be improved compared to this one.",batman new film already guess title potential perhaps biggest blockbuster year also lead box office end see let look quality first focus basic

"I like that this movie actually makes Gotham City feel like Gotham City and not Chicago. It has an interesting opening. The cast in and of itself isn't bad.That about exhausts the good things to be said about this overrated mess. As usual they've decided it is very important that Batman has absolutely no personality whatsoever. Bruce Wayne doesn't even factor in, he's barely in the film. Paul Dano is well cast, but trying *way* too hard, the performance is pretty cringe. Catwoman is a snooze. Dialogue is clichÃ© and silly and over-expository. The ""I Am Vengeance!"" theme isn't very coherent - it's like they just thought the line sounded cool (it doesn't) and arbitrarily stuffed it in, and then tried to make some kind of theme tied to the line after the fact. The nod to Batman being in ""detective mode"" is nothing more than a superficial nod ... Columbo he ain't. He'll notice something stupidly obvious, or think of the answer to a cheesy riddle, and you're supposed to be wowed by his intellect. Emo ""Kurt Cobain"" Batman IS here, so if that's your thing, enjoy. He even wears his sunglasses inside! ðŸ™„ So tortured. Commissioner Gordon seems to have the IQ of a potato for some reason.

"I was looking forward to this film when it hit cinemas and what I got was something decent, but not as great as I was hoping. The aesthetic of Gotham city I found to be appropriate as it is a dirty and grimy environment that emulates the world from the comics. This film utilizes the detective aspect of Batman, which is unlike other adaptations of the character. The filmmaking is good as I can recall a couple of scenes where the intentions were clear and cinematography was on point. The action is also admittedly good, the batmobile chase scene being my favorite set piece in the film. Performances were overall decent with Colin Farell being the standout as the Penguin, surprisingly. Now, I usually don't mind long movies, as long as there is something in them that warrants that kind of runtime (maybe the characters or the story), but in the case of The Batman, I don't think it should've been as long as it was. A few of the writing decisions took me out of the story as well. The biggest problem I have with this film overall is that it overcompensates. Not to insult the movie, I just felt the writers tried to do too much. Some scenes go on longer than they need to to the point where it gets a little tedious and certain actors try harder than they need to. I believe a trimming down to two and a half hours would've benefitted the movie greatly. All in all, a decent comic book film that wasn't as good as it could've been. Final verdict: 7/10.",looking forward film hit cinema got something decent great hoping aesthetic gotham city found appropriate dirty grimy environment emulates world comic film utilizes detective aspect batman unlike adaptation character filmmaking good recall couple scene intention clear cinematography point action also admittedly good batmobile chase scene favorite set piece film performance overall decent colin farell standout penguin surprisingly usually mind long movie long something warrant kind runtime maybe character story case batman think long writing decision took story well biggest problem film overall overcompensates insult movie felt writer tried much scene go longer need point get little tedious certain actor try harder need believe trimming two half hour would benefitted movie greatly decent comic book film good could final verdict,positive,471
Absolutely hated this film was checking the time hoping for the end. I don't like him as Batman at all and clearly they have decided to go in a different direction to the Dark Knight Trilogy but I didn't get it at all.No chemistry between him and Catwoman. Couldn't care less when Alfred was hurt unlike the Dark Knight was just an afterthought.The villains reasoning of being an orphan that no one cared about whilst everyone was sad for billionaire orphan Bruce was also weak in my opinion.The city was flooded so millions would die anyway. So many flaws in what was happening.The worst part of it all was he was essentially a detective dressed up as a bat working crimes.Just all round awful and I am very unlikely to watch the second one whenever it comes out.,absolutely hated film checking time hoping end like batman clearly decided go different direction dark knight trilogy get chemistry catwoman care le alfred hurt unlike dark knight afterthought villain reasoning orphan one cared whilst everyone sad billionaire orphan bruce also weak opinion city flooded million would die anyway many flaw happening worst part essentially detective dressed bat working crime round awful unlikely watch second one whenever come,negative,472

"After hearing raving reviews about it along with a 7.8 IMDB score, I was looking forward to seeing what the hype was all about with this new Batman installment.I agree with some other top rated reviews that say that the first ten minutes seemed promising, but it sort of devolves into what is kind of like a Dark Knight wannabe that never quite lands, mainly because the Riddler actually surprisingly comes off as a pathetic villain, the storyline and plot is surprisingly a generic paint by numbers crime story, and the detective work never even rises above Tom Hanks' pursuit of the Da Vinci Code codebreaking.Additionally, it is too long and the casting of the roles that have been solidified in our Batman ether never quite convince. It had some interesting bits and sequences, but ultimately I fell asleep after about two hours and have no plans to finish. It is actually very boring and felt like forced tension and forced darkness, unlike The Dark Knight, which had a great pacing, sharp editing, powerful performances, and a more organically established darker vibe surrounding Gotham and the Joker.

"Individually, there's nothing that necessarily stands out as downright terrible, though the score/sound design/music (let's just call all that ""sound "" from here out) comes very, very close, but even if falls into that category, that alone shouldn't result in such a boring, bland movie, but here we are...The cinematography is good, the acting is acceptable. The script isn't even necessarily bad, but everything combined together somehow results in a movie that is borderline unwatchable despite its huge budget, great visuals, costume design, strong cast, etc.You'll be able to tell if you're going to like this movie (and agree with my review) in the first 10 minutes as it's immediately apparent throughout the first scenes that the director has utterly failed in his endeavor to create a ""dark, film noir.""In The Batman, the opening scenes are trying so very hard to be ""grisly and menacing"" but the lack of atmosphere is so pronounced you feel as if you're watching a post-production rough edit that's yet to receive the final touches from sound...For a reminder of how important sound is to a movie, consider the opening scene of Blade Runner 2049 vs The Batman. The sound design immediately sucks you into the Blade Runner world and the opening scene, score, and landscape gives a sense of the grandiose scope of the movie, but in The Batman there's nothing gives you that grand feeling of a ""cinematic"" event or ""world building"" which is actually quite a remarkable feat given the scope of the project.As for the music...The Batman was surely hoping for a result similar to The Crow and how its music played as big a role as the actors and set in terms of creating the mood.As you sit and hear the familiar chords of Nirvana's ""Something in the Way"" come in with the ""grisly"" scene that's in front you you, your mind tells you, this should be an absolutely amazing, perfect song for this moment.However, it so misses the mark that it's actually jarring. The fact that this feels so completely hollow and soulless despite the context of everything going on only shines a bright spotlight on the fact that this movie's main problem is that it feels utterly soulless.You realize the inclusion of the song is merely a desperate attempt to score ""cool"" points and appeal to nostalgia rather than part of an artistic vision or moment created by the director/film.In essence, it feels like your parents turning up the car stereo to your favorite song and singing along.And it's this moment that made it clear. This is simply a big budget generic ""film noir"" that's been pieced together by people (mainly director) who might be technically proficient but completely devoid any ""artistic"" vision and movie making ""magic.""This emotional vacuum plagues the entire movie and is perhaps perfectly personified by Pattinson's performance.I wouldn't even call his performance inherently bad. His somewhat ""flat"" delivery was assuredly 100% intentional, but the ""movie making"" of everyone else (esp. The director, Matt Reeves) is simply not good enough to create the setting for such a performance to come off correctly...This is a remarkable feat for anyone who's seen Pattison's recent work and has likely been impressed with how natural and captivating his recent performances have been UNDER GOOD DIRECTION (notably The King, Good Time, The Lighthouse, etc). Given good direction and moving making I believe there could have been a utterly amazing movie and performance.Finally, to end with a simple summary....

"I have to admit; I walked out of The Batman. It's one thing for a film to deal with a dark society ('dark' as in corrupt, depressed, cynical) but another thing entirely for the film to be shot in all-but-total darkness. I don't know whose idea this was, nor do I understand why so many other reviewers found this physical darkness to be a plus, but it left me wondering (1) Why? (2) What; as in what's happening?

"Robert pattinson as batman was weird.. It's like a teen batman..and as a 25 yo.. I found that soooo unappealing ..hard to take him seriously..
Zoe kravitz as catwoman was horrible...she did horrible acting.. Again, catwoman is all about the looks.. Pfft.. And they even ruined her looks with a dorky mask and a dorky haircut..
Paul Dano as the riddler was embarrassing.. So NOT intimidating and he sounds like a dweeb...
Colin Farrell was really fun as the penguin...But his total screen time is like 5 minutes or something lol..
Jeffrey Wright as Gordon was okay...mainly because Jeffrey Wright is so likable in general..

And for a super hero movie, it doesn't have swag... Weak action and fight scenes ( especially catwoman ughhh ).. Weak acting like I said..

"Do yourself a favor, go watch Morbius instead! Having seen both movies, I am more than convinced that Batman doesn't live up to his name and would be better called Detective Wayne instead and Morbius should rather be called Batman.That aside, this movie was such a Snoozefest.

Quite sinister and dangerously insane.........until he took the mask off ðŸ¤£Arguably the worst Batman movie of all time.

"Inspector Batman investigates, or should I say, gets informed about the murdering of a series of crooks by a psychopath, completely failling to predict his next move of even influencing it.

Obtaining information too late is even the less difficult sometimes, as it may involve creating a big highway accident. Having been informed by an honest mistake made by the murderer that the new mayor and her supporters would be killed, Batman kind of succeed at saving somes by fighting a bunch of amateur gunmen. Having a Batman that fails at times make him more human and compelling, but having a Batman that doesn't drive the story forward at all makes a boring movie.Robert Pattinson plays a stoic Bruce Wayne that barely talk or move his face, and a too often casual Batman talking like a bored employee on the job.The movie is too often in the same pretty depressing ambiance instead of intriguing film noir feeling that a few times it achieves.Possibly the worst Batman movie ever.",inspector batman investigates say get informed murdering series crook psychopath completely failling predict next move even influencing one point batman get informed tv father paid mafia bos shut reporter obtaining information late even le difficult sometimes may involve creating big highway accident informed honest mistake made murderer new mayor supporter would killed batman kind succeed saving somes fighting bunch amateur gunman batman fails time make human compelling batman drive story forward make boring movie robert pattinson play stoic bruce wayne barely talk move face often casual batman talking like bored employee job movie often pretty depressing ambiance instead intriguing film noir feeling time achieves possibly worst batman movie ever,negative,493

It wasn't bad Paul Dano did great with what he had, and so did most of the actors, it's just that their characters were not very well written, and there are many plot holes.In the end, don't go in with high expectations otherwise you will not enjoy it, but it is still a respectable effort.",may hype may watcheda lot movie may really love nolan trilogy combined movie reach mean bad movie first good thing acting good action good world building good detective side batman probably best side film problem none impressive good kept expecting movie riddle mind kind heavy plot twist like se en since similar vibe least dialogue stick brain get thinking villain perspective like joker several time nolan villain matter bad paul dano great actor character well written many plot hole end go high expectation otherwise enjoy still respectable effort,positive,501
"From the first scene itself, it is made clear the amount of thought, work and creativity that has gone into the making of this movie. This movie will scare you, indulge you in its mystery, excite you with its action and amaze you with its commitment to telling a truly dark and gritty tale about the corruption in Gotham. Matt Reeves has done masterful work in directing each scene. He is a point of view driven director. There are many shots in this movie where he puts you in the character's shoes and shows the world from his point of view and how the world perceives him. As Batman enters the crime scene you are put in his POV and can see how much each and every police officer sees him as a menace and doesn't want him to be there. This really helps establish the world and the relationship within in a very subtle way. He also has wonderfully implemented some scenes of horror and thriller which were unexpected and had given way to some nailbiting and riveting scenes! (I think I forgot to breathe during the Batmobile chase scene)
All the Matt Reeves direction has been enhanced by Greg Fraser's camerawork. Gotham is very dark and gritty but never feels dead. Unlike so many other movies, he allowed blacks to be actual black and not shades of grey and then dialled up the contrast allowing the colours to pop! Orange and blue colour has such amazing interplay between them and completely suits the dark depressing setting of Gotham.Michael Giacchino's score for The Batman is his best work yet. As the film picks up in terms of action, you can start hearing little hints of Dum-Da-Dum-Dum pick up and you just know things are going to get intense. Other than the adrenaline-filled main theme he through his soundtrack is very well able to showcase moments of mystery, emotion and romance (Yes, this movie has romance!)
This might have been the least amount of talking done by The Batman in any of the Batman movies because Robert Pattinson is so well able to display emotions through his body language and expressions. Pattinson brings in a different take on Bruce Wayne, who is depressed and a little eccentric. A billionaire who has travelled the world to gather knowledge and is always analysing his surrounding is bound to be an introvert and kind of a recluse and this is very well showcased by him. Robert has done an amazing job. Talking about side characters there were loads of them and each one of them has done an amazing job. For me, the stand-out was definitely Penguin and Catwoman.The story is a straight-up murder mystery thriller where Batman and Gordon are sent on a hunt by Riddler which reveals the deep dark secret of Gotham Elites including Batman's own past. Without spoiling much the story plays out very much like Se7en, Zodiac and The Long Halloween comic book. This allows the world's greatest detective to actually do some detective work and you get lost in that journey to trying to piece all the different puzzle pieces. The Batman is not a good story because it's an indulging murder mystery but because it allows the characters within to grow as well. As Batman, Catwoman, Alfred and Penguin are caught in the middle of these murders they all grow as a character in their own way which makes me excited for the sequel.Finally, I would like to say in a world where most of the comic-book movies now seem like a painting of scenery you have seen a thousand times being sold in Walmart, here is a movie that is something that is hung on the entrance of a downtown museum brought to life by Picasso.",first scene made clear amount thought work creativity gone making movie movie scare indulge mystery excite action amaze commitment telling truly dark gritty tale corruption gotham matt reef done masterful work directing scene point view driven director many shot movie put character shoe show world point view world perceives batman enters crime scene put pov see much every police officer see menace want really help establish world relationship within subtle way also wonderfully implemented scene horror thriller unexpected given way nailbiting riveting scene think forgot breathe batmobile chase scene matt reef direction enhanced greg fraser camerawork gotham dark gritty never feel dead unlike many movie allowed black actual black shade grey dialled contrast allowing colour pop orange blue colour amazing interplay completely suit dark depressing setting gotham michael giacchino score batman best work yet film pick term action start hearing little hint dum da dum dum pick know thing going get intense adrenaline filled main theme soundtrack well able showcase moment mystery emotion romance yes movie romance might least amount talking done batman batman movie robert pattinson well able display emotion body language expression pattinson brings different take bruce wayne depressed little eccentric billionaire travelled world gather knowledge always analysing surrounding bound introvert kind recluse well showcased robert done amazing job talking side character load one done amazing job stand definitely penguin catwoman story straight murder mystery thriller batman gordon sent hunt riddler reveals deep dark secret gotham elite including batman past without spoiling much story play much like se en zodiac long halloween comic book allows world greatest detective actually detective work get lost journey trying piece different puzzle piece batman good story indulging murder mystery allows character within grow well batman catwoman alfred penguin caught middle murder grow character way make excited sequel finally would like say world comic book movie seem like painting scenery seen thousand time sold walmart movie something hung entrance downtown museum brought life picasso,positive,502

"First, two disclaimers:1. English is not my native language
2. I'm a fan of Batman only in the movies. I've seen them all, but I haven't read any comics.With that said, I begin.If we imagine a world in which Batman has never existed and neither have his movies, this could be considered a good, entertaining movie.But let's talk about the character: a battered Batman, with a Bruce Wayne straight out of a 2000s My Chemical Romance videoclip. What I was waiting for: emo Batman. In addition to a shallow and unconsistent character, I think the character itself was not achieved, badly. He does not captivate, he does not surprise. When you see Bruce Wayne you're in awe, he's stunned. Robert Pattinson achieves none of this.Let's talk about Selina Kyle's character: well accomplished and deep. Good performance from Zoë.

What is this about kissing him unconscious?Another thing that disturbed me was that peogresist cliché scene criticizing ""white people's privilege.""

The only reason I watched this whole movie was coz I paid good money in a cinema to watch The Batman. If it were a movie made for teenagers and presented itself as such I wouldn't mind it. But the audacity to pretend that this is a serious ""dark"" movie and then getting 85 on RT, 8.4 on IMDb, I must've seen the wrong semi-comical ""so bad it's terrible"" version. Please don't water your time money effort to watch this pile of s$#@ movie. Watch literally anything else instead. The terrible car chase, to call it a cliche would be insulting all decent cliches in other films. The emo Batman look, I mean I thought Pattinson had left Twilight behind him with movies like Lighthouse and Good time. I get it he needs to make some big bucks and doing a superhero movie is a good way to go about it but c'mon!!!But all this side, I just can't get over the fact that it's getting good, even great reviews from audiences and critics alike.

"It really looks good. Great cinematography.BUT, it is definitely lacking in spark and punch. And it simply does NOT have the magic of earlier terrific batman movies like the Dark Knight.More bad: it lasts almost 3 hours.

This actor should be starring in commercials for perfume or something. But he simply does not convince me of being a tough superhero. No way.Not any good then?

"When reviews/rating(8.3/10 then) of the movie are so great you expect it to be a better film, but when the movie ended I was wondering if I watched the same film; because It was just a disappointing movie.

I suppose the big question is would I watch this movie again?

"A vengeful chiropterian vigilante is administering street justice in Gotham City, only to discover that the villainy and corruption is much deeper, and closer to home, than expected. Apparently this reboot strove to be more sepulchral, melodramatic, and 'realistic' than its predecessors and ended up just being dark, boring and far too long. Robert Pattinson is fine buried under the bat-suit but as Bruce Wayne, he just looks sad and beaten (and his hair reminded me of the Goth Kids on 'South Park'). The cinematography is irredeemably dark, and trying to make a 'realistic' film just showcases the inherent ridiculousness of a crime-fighter dressed as a bat. Nothing in this film hasn't been done better in the Burton or Nolan franchises and I find it amusingly ironic when Hollywood highlights characters who righteously go after people who are making 'too much money' (there was some surprise that Pattinson 'only' made 3 million dollars to play the caped crusader).",vengeful chiropterian vigilante administering street justice gotham city discover villainy corruption much deeper closer home expected apparently reboot strove sepulchral melodramatic realistic predecessor ended dark boring far long robert pattinson fine buried bat suit bruce wayne look sad beaten hair reminded goth kid south park cinematography irredeemably dark trying make realistic film showcase inherent ridiculousness crime fighter dressed bat nothing film done better burton nolan franchise find amusingly ironic hollywood highlight character righteously go people making much money surprise pattinson made million dollar play caped crusader,positive,527

"Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of The Batman; here's the breakdown of my ratings:Story: 1.25
Direction: 1.25
Pace: 0.50
Acting: 1.00
Enjoyment: 1.25TOTAL: 5.25 out of 10.00What is it with directors at the moment? Why are they looking to make EPIC-length movies that aren't EPIC? I shouldn't be surprised at DC delivering yet another terrible movie. However, I am a creature of nature and forever hopeful that the money-grubbers at DC will realise they're slicing into their own cash-cow throats by not utilising the comic-book stable's talent.So we have Matt Reeves and Peter Craig taking control of the word processors. And let's face it, Reeve's best writing project was War For The Planet Of The Apes, and Craig's was The Hunger Games - Mockingjay Parts 1 and 2, so The Batman should have been decent. And, on the whole, it was. Though, many DC characters took a few changes to their personas and origin stories. But being an Elseworlds fan, I'm used to change. At least the guy's kept the characters' fundamental personalities correct, except for Bruce Wayne's. But what Reeves and Craig give the viewer is better. At the start of this tale of the Dark Knight, the Batman is out for vengeance against the evil polluting Gotham City. By the film's climax, he realises vengeance is not the way to go. I liked this concept for two reasons. One - it could have happened, and it doesn't revise Wayne's or Batman's rudimentary character for the worse: And two - it allows the writers to show growth in the primary character. The Riddler's story of uncovering the corruption at the heart of Gotham is also intriguing and engaging. Sadly, it suffered from poor structuring and missed opportunities. But the poorest element of the story is the amount of nothingness it holds and the direction it received.The Batman is not Matt Reeves's best movie. In fact, compared to the other films I've watched that he directed, I would hasten to say The Batman is the worst of his crop. So when I mentioned the nothingness in the story, it's chiefly down to the direction. Inconceivably, Reeves's opted to use one of the slowest paces I've witnessed in a superhero movie. The Batman has the feel of being filmed in slow motion. The only exceptions to the tedious tempo are the fight and chase sequences, which are superb. But everything else is drawn out to the maximum, and for a three-hour movie, it makes it one hell of a trawl. And it left me with one question - was it all worth it? Had Reeves filmed the movie at a moderate tempo, I reckon he could've shaved off an hour from the runtime, and that could have been more if he'd cut all the superfluous scenes - of which there are many. Another downfall of Reeves is his lack of originality. Since he chose a slow pace, he should have realised for it to work perfectly, he needed to make each and every one of the scenes excellent. And they aren't. Regrettably, he's not a master of his trade, and it's more than evident in The Batman. James Bond's latest outing, No Time To Die, suffers from similar issues, but at least director Cory Fukunaga gives the viewers a plethora of eye candy to keep them pleasured. Reeves needed to add more intrigue to his scenes. One or two are good, most are okay, and many are below-par and uninteresting. That said, at least he got the griminess of Gotham correct. Though, Wayne's Gothic home in The Wayne Building was laughably over-the-top. And the CGI car chase between Penguin and Batman would have been infinitely better without Reeves's homage to JJ Abrams and all the lens flares.As for the cast... I disliked the choices the casting directors made. At least George Clooney should have lost the mantle of being the worst Batman - though that was down to the director's handling and not the actor. Robert Pattinson doesn't cut it as either Bruce Wayne or Batman. As Bruce, he's sullen, moody, and lacking drive - though this could be down to the writing. Worst yet, he's too unattractive to be a Billionaire Playboy - but, hey, maybe it's all about the Billions and not the looks? As Batman, well, he's just a wannabe Christian Bale, crappy croaky whisper and all. John Turturro, who's a brilliant actor, underplays Carmine Falcone's tough, cocky, sure, and self-confident gangster image. And what the hell is with the cardigans? God, when you get old, you do lose all sense of dress. But at least this flick kept some knitters busy. Not just with Falcone's cardies but also with the bad kitty's half-balaclavas - complete with pointy pussy ears. Even the great Andy Serkis as Alfred is second-rate. For a man who taught Bruce to fight and has looked after him for most of his life, he's more like walking wallpaper than somebody of interest. Paul Dano as The Riddler is okay, but I wanted to hit him when he took to wailing pitifully. It brought back images of Jesse Eisenberg as Unsexy Lexy Luthor.The Batman is not the worst that DC has brought out. The story is a good one and possesses some appealing and enjoyable elements. Sadly, the movie is way too long, and it's due to miserably retarded tempo. It would have benefited from being an hour shorter, with more engaging cinematography. It also wouldn't have hurt to include some warmheartedness and humour along the way. The tempo and the sulky hero make the film a tad depressing - It's not a movie to watch if you're not on your meds. So was it worth it? No, not at three hours. As such, I'd only recommend watching The Batman if you, like me, are a DC Fan and adored The Batman character. Otherwise, treat yourselves to either the Burton Batman - which is still one of the best adaptations - or the Nolan flick, Batman Begins.Now Riddle Me This: Where have I placed The Batman on my Holding Out For A Hero, Obsidian Dreams, and The Final Frontier lists?

"I was very much looking forward to this movie partly because The Batman has always been my favorite superhero and partly because I found Affleck's Batman to be wanting....a lot.Unfortunately I bailed at about 90 minutes into this one. There is so much wrong with this movie then I don't know where to begin. Well, a good beginning is Batman himself; Pattinson is terrible. I'm very well acquainted with the Batman canon, he's supposed to be dark and brooding...but he's not supposed to be as dull as dishwater. Pattinson apparently interpreted dark and brooding as boring and totally lacking in any type of personality. He was out-acted by almost anyone else on screen, and considering some of the weak acting in this movie that is saying a lot.The Riddler was just as bad, totally bland and unimaginative villain. I understand that Heath Ledger is always going to be a tough act to follow but how about at least trying?Worst I think was the story itself though. It was too long by an hour, to convoluted and too murky. This is basically a serial killer movie with some guy in a bat suit squeezed in there for effect. It was so slow and so mind numbing that I couldn't even finish it...and I've watched every Batman movie out there, even George Clooney's!A few final quick observations; I'm not sure why Alfred was even in the film for all the impact he had. Alfred was always a major character in the canon. In this film it seemed like they just stopped at some point and said; ""oh wait, we've got to have some guy named Alfred to be the butler, get someone!""
As bland as Pattinson was as Batman he was even worse as Bruce Wayne. Apparently the ""crown prince of Gotham"" doesn't actually need to have a personality.Batman movies are supposed to be dark but this film was so dark it was depressing. It was way overdone.The only casting choice I thought was marginally ok was Cat Woman, but even that was bad because she made Pattinson's Batman look even worse whenever they were on screen together. And her acting wasn't that great either, his was just worse.Hollywood, please consider dumping this one in the same discount bin as Superman Returns (2006) and try again with a new Batman, a new director and new writers.

"The Batman was directed by Matt Reeves, who co-wrote the screenplay with Peter Craig, Reeves also produced the film alongside others. This film is a reboot of the Batman film franchise and is set in a separate universe away from the DC Extended Universe, thus giving Matt Reeves full rein on his Batman universe. One of the choices he made was to explore Batman's detective side more than what previous films had done, drawing inspiration from 1970s films and comics such as ""Year One"", The Long Halloween and Ego. I would say Matt Reeves succeeded with it, making it stand out from other Batman films and most importantly, making it feel like a Batman film. His interpretation is grounded, accurate and overall fantastic for a fan of live action and comic book. The presence from its inspiration from Year One and The Long Halloween is felt and rightfully so, they're some of my favorite Batman graphic novels after all and Reeves' screenplay and Story is truly perfect and mesmerizing. So is his direction and visual storytelling, brilliantly done.During the second year of Bruce Wayne's career as Batman. The Riddler, a sadistic serial killer, begins murdering key political figures in Gotham, Batman is forced to investigate the city's hidden corruption and question his family's involvement.Robert Pattinson plays Bruce Wayne / Batman: a reclusive billionaire who obsessively protects Gotham City as a masked vigilante to cope with his traumatic past. Batman is around 30 years old and is not yet an experienced crime fighter, as director Matt Reeves wanted to explore the character before he becomes ""fully formed"", which in my opinion was the right choice to do. Zoë Kravitz plays Selina Kyle / Catwoman: a nightclub waitress, drug dealer, and cat burglar who meets Batman while searching for her missing roommate; her moral ambiguity challenges Batman's black-and-white view of good and evil. Paul Dano plays Edward Nashton / Riddler: a serial killer who targets elite Gotham citizens and livestreams his crimes. The Riddler seeks to ""unmask the truth"" about Gotham, taunting Batman and law enforcement with riddles. Jeffrey Wright plays James Gordon: an ally of Batman in the Gotham City Police Department. The only GCPD officer who Batman trusts. They're the leads, the supporting cast is too full of well known names like: Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth, John Turturro as Carmine Falcone, Colin Farrell as Oswald ""Oz"" Cobblepot / Penguin and Peter Sarsgaard as Gil Colson.Greig Fraser worked as the cinematographer for this project and his beautiful cinematography is felt in every scene, together with the director, he made a cinematic masterpiece with it being one of the best shot superhero movies. But there's something with this character, this mythology and just Gotham in general that draws filmmakers and cinematographers to create stunning looking films, The Batman is among them. Michael Giacchino's musical score is well fantastic in a lot of ways, honestly one of the best musical scores I've ever heard, possibly. The film wouldn't be as good if it weren't for Giacchino's work, it's incredible. The editing is excellent. Production and art design are brilliant, I'll say the same to the sets and props. It feels like Gotham with its Gothic style, the Gargoyles and interiors, like the animated show and original Batman film or the Arkham games. The action sequences aren't over the top, they're too grounded and thus realistic. They're also shot extremely nice like the rest of the movie, an example of a well shot and epic action sequence are the dark corridor and another is the car chase. There's so many more and Matt Reeves truly nailed the action in this film, the fights seemed so human as this Batman is still so new to the violence as here he isn't truly the world's greatest detective or a beacon of hope, but something that the criminals fear, he's Vengeance.The Batman met my expectations and it's now regarded as one of the best superhero films I've seen, with its perfect cinematography and direction but also how gripping, gorgeous and how it's the grounded detective story the character deserves. Matt Reeves trusted his instincts with casting Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne and his interpretation is one of the best I've seen, I don't think another actor would have done such a good job with this version of the character, Robert was indeed the person Reeves wrote the character for. I also want to add how I loved Zoë Kravitz in the role as Selina Kyle, she brought the character straight from the comics and well it's brilliant. So Robert, Zoë and Paul Dano bring superb performances that you'll remember for a long time, but I didn't expect Jeffrey Wright would pull this impressive performance as James Gordon he truly made a special performance, a strong performance. Paul Dano likened the Riddler to the Zodiac Killer, whom he felt was the ""real-life"" Riddler for his practice of communicating with ciphers and riddles. It was the right choice, his performance is incredible and will be remembered fondly for years to come. Though Colin Farrell doesn't have a lot of screen time, he leaves a mark and a memorable performance as Oswald ""Oz"" Cobblepot / Penguin, I can't wait to see him in the upcoming spin off show and sequel as his performance was extremely memorable and entertaining to watch.I think this is a perfect movie but for a long review, I think I need to criticize something and I've read many critics criticizing the length of the movie and I don't agree with that as I feel it's needed for an epic noir driven tale about Batman's second year, I actually wanted the first and second act to be longer. I did feel the final thirty minutes or so could have been trimmed a little bit and maybe change some of the writing but I don't want to spoil anything in this review, the final act is still great though don't get me wrong, but there's a tiny flaw with it.Matt Reeves' rebooted Batman is a movie worth checking out, but also worth going back to as there's lots of references and easter eggs to be found. Matt Reeves respects the comics and the large mythology surrounding Batman and Gotham.

"The Batman, directed by Matt Reeves and starring Robert Pattinson, is a crime thriller/film noir take on the dark knight. Met with generally high praise from critics and audiences alike, the Batman soared into box office highs right off the bat. The Batman drew acclaim for its visuals, performances, score, and gritty atmosphere, drawing viewers deep into its world of crime, justice, and vengeance. While it is indeed well made and delves into themes and ideas heretofore unseen in batman films, The Batman is far from perfect and stumbles in some of its most important elements.The first hour and a half of the Batman is an engrossing film that hits on all cylinders and showcases Reeves technical talent and ability to incorporate Fincher like elements into his script. I was on the edge of my seat and the action scenes, while limited, were brilliant and exciting. Batman jumped from one crime scene to the next and the riddler kept outsmarting him at every turn, making for an engaging story of cat and mouse. Then came the third act and the movie began to fall apart. Reeves, on top of forcing in a severely under written love story, fell pray to the cardinal marvel movie sin: a by the numbers action movie mumbo jumbo conclusion. After all the buildup, the riddler is sidelined in his own war and batman fights a bunch of masked thugs. Michael Giacchino tries his best to make the broken-hearted love story seem emotional but, ultimately, can only do so much with his music. While I do believe they provided a solid character arc for batman, starting him out as a man of vengeance and then making him realize that those ideals are shared by his enemies, they dropped the ball on a finale that could've capped off greatness.",batman directed matt reef starring robert pattinson crime thriller film noir take dark knight met generally high praise critic audience alike batman soared box office high right bat batman drew acclaim visuals performance score gritty atmosphere drawing viewer deep world crime justice vengeance indeed well made delf theme idea heretofore unseen batman film batman far perfect stumble important element first hour half batman engrossing film hit cylinder showcase reef technical talent ability incorporate fincher like element script edge seat action scene limited brilliant exciting batman jumped one crime scene next riddler kept outsmarting every turn making engaging story cat mouse came third act movie began fall apart reef top forcing severely written love story fell pray cardinal marvel movie sin number action movie mumbo jumbo conclusion buildup riddler sidelined war batman fight bunch masked thug michael giacchino try best make broken hearted love story seem emotional ultimately much music believe provided solid character arc batman starting man vengeance making realize ideal shared enemy dropped ball finale could capped greatness,positive,546

"I am a big Batman fan and have been for many years, I went into this film with low expectations and they didn't disappoint! I so wanted it to be something special but it really wasn't, I really like Robert Pattinson as an actor but as Batman... he just didn't fit the part.The film was excruciatingly long and for what? They could have easily trimmed half an hour off just by cutting down the time people stared at each other!Towards the end it started to feel like they just added a bit more to finish the film off and then a bit more and finally a bit more and most of it felt unnecessary.I saw it in imax and the loud noises were loud(which was good, it helped keep me awake at points) but some of the talking almost seemed muffled!It was unnecessarily dark alot but in a washed out sort of way. At times it would seem almost unviewable but didn't feel like it was supposed to be!Andy serkis is another great actor but was totally wasted on playing Alfred.Jeffrey wright was an awesome Jim Gordon but he was a far cry from the make Gotham great Jim and more of a dependent on Batman to do his job for him JimThe fight scenes were pretty cool and well choreographed but for a 3 hour long film there wasn't enough and nowhere near as brutal as I went into the film believing them to be, also I understand that this film was set as year 2 Batman but why was he almost invincible? There were times when he should have been hurt, like probably not getting up from that one hurt and he just kinda shrugged it off without a scratchAnd finally, we were told we were getting a dark, unhinged and creepy Riddler, he started strong, when we finally see him without his mask he has a brief moment of looking the real deal and then in the blink of an eye he became nothing and ended up just being a disgruntled Redditor who recruited a small army of keyboard warriors to finish his plan, but why allow them to catch him so easily anyway? I know he's crazy but he still has a logical brain! Surely at that point he wouldn't have already know that it was easier getting out of Arkham than a wet paper bag!And the worlds greatest detective didn't even realise what the end game was until the riddler basically told him and by the time he worked it out he was already too late!If you want to watch a dark gritty comic book film noir just rewatch Watchmen, better story, better soundtrack, better lighting and better pacing.",big batman fan many year went film low expectation disappoint wanted something special really really like robert pattinson actor batman fit part film excruciatingly long could easily trimmed half hour cutting time people stared towards end started feel like added bit finish film bit finally bit felt unnecessary saw imax loud noise loud good helped keep awake point talking almost seemed muffled unnecessarily dark alot washed sort way time would seem almost unviewable feel like supposed andy serkis another great actor totally wasted playing alfred jeffrey wright awesome jim gordon far cry make gotham great jim dependent batman job jimthe fight scene pretty cool well choreographed hour long film enough nowhere near brutal went film believing also understand film set year batman almost invincible time hurt like probably getting one hurt kinda shrugged without scratchand finally told getting dark unhinged creepy riddler started strong finally see without mask brief moment looking real deal blink eye became nothing ended disgruntled redditor recruited small army keyboard warrior finish plan allow catch easily anyway know crazy still logical brain surely point already know easier getting arkham wet paper bag world greatest detective even realise end game riddler basically told time worked already late want watch dark gritty comic book film noir rewatch watchman better story better soundtrack better lighting better pacing,positive,549

"First, a quick review of the movie itself: dull, plodding, boring, slow, amazingly sophomoric dialogue, with low rent special effects and a dark screen that is supposed to evoke something other than the extreme irritation it ultimately evokes. I mean, come on, people, if EVERY scene is dark, the contrast needed to make your point is just...missing. Only drugged out artists could possibly think that this would work. Okay. Done. Next, let's look at the MESSAGE.No, I am not going to discuss the utterly predictable preaching. I won't even go into it, but NOT for the reasons you are thinking. So, read on...Since it is currently de rigeuer to attack and topple anything that represents Virtue, and since Hollywood has been the de facto leader of such attacks for a very long time, it truly was just a matter of time before Batman's Legend would be targeted. But Batman represents a level of complexity that has been nicely explored in the Burton / Nolan BIG FIVE movies, who fully developed themes of internal struggle, external pressures, and even situational ethics. How, then, could we shatter the Batman paradigm and still be stylish? How about denigrating his ancestry? In a completely off the wall ""re-imagining"", momma is nutz, daddy is stupidly naive, and Bruce's already gigantic struggles, especially between good and evil...are a mere delusion, based on more delusion. From the people who obsess about every weakness in our Founding Fathers' personal lives, but who curiously know nothing about Marx, we are now nuking the Waynes, even to the extent of outrageously manufacturing a new maiden name for Mom.On a positive note, I literally fell asleep watching this three separate times.

"So I wasn't too keen on watching the 879th version of this rich nutjob in black tights.

While Nolan's Batman did this too, at least the action was bombastic and the villain, legendary (dearly departed joker).

"It's almost 3 hours long yet not much happens and that little that does happen isn't interesting. It really doesn't show why this movie exists, since we've seen Batman so many times. The only thing one could surmise is that this is going for a more realistic approach, but that is destroyed at the end with the silly anti-Trump finale. Not to mention that the whole idea of the Batman, Catwoman, Riddler and the rest of them is silly and it doesn't make much sense to try to make it realistic in the first place.The weird vampire from Twilight is terrible as Batman, even in the suite and mask. Yes, he's worse than Affleck, Kilmer and Clooney put together. It's not just that he doesn't look the part, hell, neither did Michael Keaton, but Keaton's Batman made sense, especially in stylized movies. This ""realistic vampire Batman"" does not.Zoe Kravitz isn't interesting enough as Catwoman. She looks good, but she's no Halle Berry or Michelle Pfeiffer, or even Anne Hathaway for that matter. Much worse, Catwoman is an interesting character, nuanced, torn, unstable, yet Zoe's Catwoman is just angry.Others simply get caught in the gravitational pull of this giant bore-hole that is the center of this movie.Quite frankly, they could have ended it after Riddler is caught. It would still be boring, but, almost an hour shorter, so much less of an impact. The whole silly anti-Trump finish would be lost, keeping more in line with the ""realistics"". While still bland, it would have at least made some sense.Unless you're a full-blown Batman fan and need to see all things Batman, skip this one. Or, if you're somehow forced to see it, go watch an episode of Adam West's Batman, to see what Batman is actually all about.",almost hour long yet much happens little happen interesting really show movie exists since seen batman many time thing one could surmise going realistic approach destroyed end silly anti trump finale mention whole idea batman catwoman riddler rest silly make much sense try make realistic first place weird vampire twilight terrible batman even suite mask yes worse affleck kilmer clooney put together look part hell neither michael keaton keaton batman made sense especially stylized movie realistic vampire batman zoe kravitz interesting enough catwoman look good halle berry michelle pfeiffer even anne hathaway matter much worse catwoman interesting character nuanced torn unstable yet zoe catwoman angry others simply get caught gravitational pull giant bore hole center movie quite frankly could ended riddler caught would still boring almost hour shorter much le impact whole silly anti trump finish would lost keeping line realistics still bland would least made sense unless full blown batman fan need see thing batman skip one somehow forced see go watch episode adam west batman see batman actually,negative,554

"The story itself is generic and feels like it was pulled from a comic book, like one issue and only one issue of the Batman comic. Theres not enough material here to warrant 2 hours and 57 minutes. Nothing terribly interesting happens to the city (we've seen Gotham almost destroyed a dozen times now, get a new schtick) and we get very little insight into any characters. You dont need all this time to tell a basic story with no character development. Could have all been done in 90 minutes or less. Most scenes just drag on pointlessly. And the visual feast only occurs in small chunks. A lot of it is dreary shots of a dreary city with loads of rain. Thats fine for 20 seconds at a time, scattered throughout the film, but you don't need to pack the runtime with pointless and ugly scenery. In this way its actually inferior to Blade Runner.All the actors do their jobs well, nothing worthy of an Oscar but they clearly put in the effort. It doesnt matter much because no part of the story really grabs the viewer and makes them feel anything. The movie wants to be angry and spirited but just comes across as dull.Having said all that, I am looking forward to the inevitable next installment, because for some reason Warner Brothers can only get it right when they use the Joker.

"I kept an open mind and finally gave it a watch. Now that I have I ask myself ""why was this made?"" Pattinson is a fine actor capable of intense, subtle interpretations. It seems the filmmaker kept him on a tight leash, I expected more from him than this languid and uninspired performance. I can't remember the rest of the cast as none of the other characters had any charisma, nuance or dramatic impact. Nothing in this film matches the potent chemistry of Bale, Freeman and Cain in the Nolan trilogy, not even the disappointing third. Certainly none of the cast measures up with either Leadger's or Phoenix's legendary Jokers - or even Bane for that matter. This feebleminded, artless, visually drab and bland attempt at Batman failed to capture the mystique of the man or the mythos of his world. Instead, we're treated to yet another steaming pile of simplistic, hysterical virtue signaling and hacky mcmovie cliches designed to separate as much cash from as many drooling screensavers as possible. Mission accomplished on that front.

"This was a waste of 6 hours of my life. Yess, I watched this crap twice before expressing my total disappointment with this unentertaining waste of time. Does anyone else want American superhero movies to be supplied with subtitles? I'm old enough to remember the early movie stars who succeeded in ""talkies"" because their diction was trained to be recorded on film, as opposed to theatrical actors who succeeded in their stage profession because they could project to the cheap seats, but were a complete disaster in the talkies. Then we spent years in the seventies to nineties getting used to the ""mumblers"" like Brando and Bob de Nero and, after an adjustment to our interpretation and learning to lip read, we grew to love them. But now actors (or is it the lack of due diligence by sound engineers?) have reached new depths of sounding out their lines in this awful movie ... and I can barely make out 10% of the dialogue, even after 2 viewings and multiple rewinds, I think that what Kravitz added to the dialogue was zero, I'd rather she was deaf and dumb and resorted to American sign (and I don't even know sign language at all) or give us some sub titles to follow so we can understand what the hell's going on.Otherwise, the cinematography palette, monochrome with a shade of red, was fine and really set the mood of the 1930s/1940s comics.The lack of intro was probably fine for superhero comic readers that were able to accept that this was a new Batman but delivered as a continuation of a familiarity of a figure that hadn't existed in comic (or ever had on silver screen) for 70 years except appreciated by a few hundred historic comic book collectors. I thought this reversion to the original dark concept could've been more successful if explained by an introductory narration. What we were left with was basically a defensive block for the average viewer if the filmmaker intended this version of Batman to only appeal to the limited audience they aimed for.Pattinson looked the part as far as stature on the screen was concerned but, as the wealthy son of a multi-millionaire, Wayne's diction should have been much clearer, I wish his voice coach had aimed for Ivy League rather than someone raised in the Gotham City Projects. As for Kravitz, her verbal contribution was pointless because I understood only a fraction of it. I did like the interaction between Batman and Lt Gordon and with Alfred (who was a seamless continuation of Caine's intonation, but should have been much more contrasted as this was supposed to be a complete departure from all previous Batman/Alfred renditions) and thought the introduction of at least one other servant into the sparse Wayne mansion maintenance regime
was at least fractionally more realistic than any previous manifestation of the dark warrior.I also found disquieting that virtually all the secondary characters that were murdered were virtually indistinguishable and, as a viewer, I cared little whether any of them lived or died, which clearly detracted from my emotional involvement in the film, only Alfred's injury was of any concern and that amounted to very little.The Batman and Catwoman themselves came across as rather characterless characters that I hated more as the film progressed rather than aided developing any positive feeling for.I really cannot recommend seeing this film at all, not only was it disappointing, it was definitively awful full stop, the definitive rubbish movie after such expectations were so comprehensively trashed.Hopefully, some future studio executive, who has any feeling for cinematic engagement and entertainment values, can take whatever film and soundtrack remains intact in backups and not swept up and destroyed on the cutting room floor, and recut this film to salvage maybe a decent 90-minute movie from this utter mess.",waste hour life yes watched crap twice expressing total disappointment unentertaining waste time anyone else want american superhero movie supplied subtitle old enough remember early movie star succeeded talkie diction trained recorded film opposed theatrical actor succeeded stage profession could project cheap seat complete disaster talkie spent year seventy ninety getting used mumbler like brando bob de nero adjustment interpretation learning lip read grew love actor lack due diligence sound engineer reached new depth sounding line awful movie barely make dialogue even viewing multiple rewinds think kravitz added dialogue zero rather deaf dumb resorted american sign even know sign language give u sub title follow understand hell going otherwise cinematography palette monochrome shade red fine really set mood comic lack intro probably fine superhero comic reader able accept new batman delivered continuation familiarity figure existed comic ever silver screen year except appreciated hundred historic comic book collector thought reversion original dark concept could successful explained introductory narration left basically defensive block average viewer filmmaker intended version batman appeal limited audience aimed pattinson looked part far stature screen concerned wealthy son multi millionaire wayne diction much clearer wish voice coach aimed ivy league rather someone raised gotham city project kravitz verbal contribution pointless understood fraction like interaction batman lt gordon alfred seamless continuation caine intonation much contrasted supposed complete departure previous batman alfred rendition thought introduction least one servant sparse wayne mansion maintenance regime least fractionally realistic previous manifestation dark warrior also found disquieting virtually secondary character murdered virtually indistinguishable viewer cared little whether lived died clearly detracted emotional involvement film alfred injury concern amounted little batman catwoman came across rather characterless character hated film progressed rather aided developing positive feeling really cannot recommend seeing film disappointing definitively awful full stop definitive rubbish movie expectation comprehensively trashed hopefully future studio executive feeling cinematic engagement entertainment value take whatever film soundtrack remains intact backup swept destroyed cutting room floor recut film salvage maybe decent minute movie utter mess,negative,569

"The Batman opens with a stunning cinematographic style - this film takes its own approach to Gotham City. It begins with a narration from Robert Pattinson's Batman about the 'fear' his existence instils in the criminals of Gotham while showing a compilation of different everyday criminals carrying out their vices. After this, Batman is introduced both excitingly and violently, beating up some thugs at a tube station, and showing little restraint. This sets the expectations that this is the Batman that will bring a darker take to the character.The first half of the film is promising, including some particularly tense scenes, such as the funeral section, sure to produce goosebumps. Michael Giacchino's consistently epic score and the always dark and rainy setting dictate the pace of the film. Until the third act, there is the expectation that there is something more to come. Something more to find within this film. However, we arrive at the third act, and the mess unfolds.This iteration of a Batman film fails in a key way - Batman starts and ends the film as entirely the same character. There is no emotional development within this character. This is no fault of Pattinson, who is suited to the role, but not given enough to work with. Throughout the film, Bruce Wayne maintains the same characteristics, aggression, emotion from start to finish. As mentioned, near the beginning, Batman aggressively beats some thugs at a train station, showing little restraint. Near the end of the film Batman, again, aggressively beats one of Riddler's gunners, requiring Jeffrey Wright's James Gordon to stop him. There was simply no development of the character that resulted in his actions changing. At one point, the Bat learns that his father may not be the man he thought, and there was a great opportunity for a significant plot device to the story. However, after a brief exposition from Andy Serkis' Alfred Pennyworth, the matter is essentially settled, and Bruce offers no further reaction to this revelation. Perhaps where Pattinson is most allowed to provide emotion is through the narration of his journals, which are very good scenes, but the fact that this is where the most emotion is displayed is a disappointment. It could be said that The Batman needed less action and more storytelling.Paul Dano's Riddler is not the best of villains. His performance seems to usher in an essence of Heath Ledger's Joker, however, at times, it seems over the top. Regardless, up until the third act, he is nonetheless intriguing. He convincingly comes across as delusional, but somewhat justified. He is trying to cure the city of its corruption. However, this all falters away as soon as Matt Reeves decides that Riddler's actions should turn from targeting corrupt officials to anyone and everyone, including innocent civilians. Why this is done I truly do not know. The Riddler's motives become completely muddled, and he simply fades away as a generic killer seeking total destruction.As for the other characters in the film, Colin Farrell's Penguin is criminally underused. He had almost no significant role in the outcome of the story. Whether he was in the film or not, almost nothing of the outcome would have changed. It was almost as if this film teased the character as a marketing tool to promote the Penguin TV show, announced before this film was released. Farrell's performance is nonetheless excellent, as well as the makeup design of the character.As to quick mentions of other characters, Zoe Kravitz's Catwoman was fine. Jeffrey Wright was great as Officer Gordon and had a surprising amount of screentime. As for John Turturro as Falcone, it almost seemed like this character unnecessarily took attention away from better ones like Oswald Cobblepot.The Batman is certainly not a bad film, it is actually quite enjoyable. However, serious problems with the writing severely hinder it. The film had me thinking of David Fincher's Zodiac throughout. The cryptic puzzles laid out by the Riddler, the incredible darkness. I cannot help but think this film is both worse than The Dark Knight and worse than Zodiac. If you want a spectacular Batman film, head in Christopher Nolan's direction; if you want a cryptic, chilling detective film, look to Zodiac.",batman open stunning cinematographic style film take approach gotham city begin narration robert pattinson batman fear existence instils criminal gotham showing compilation different everyday criminal carrying vice batman introduced excitingly violently beating thug tube station showing little restraint set expectation batman bring darker take character first half film promising including particularly tense scene funeral section sure produce goosebump michael giacchino consistently epic score always dark rainy setting dictate pace film third act expectation something come something find within film however arrive third act mess unfolds iteration batman film fails key way batman start end film entirely character emotional development within character fault pattinson suited role given enough work throughout film bruce wayne maintains characteristic aggression emotion start finish mentioned near beginning batman aggressively beat thug train station showing little restraint near end film batman aggressively beat one riddler gunner requiring jeffrey wright james gordon stop simply development character resulted action changing one point bat learns father may man thought great opportunity significant plot device story however brief exposition andy serkis alfred pennyworth matter essentially settled bruce offer reaction revelation perhaps pattinson allowed provide emotion narration journal good scene fact emotion displayed disappointment could said batman needed le action storytelling paul dano riddler best villain performance seems usher essence heath ledger joker however time seems top regardless third act nonetheless intriguing convincingly come across delusional somewhat justified trying cure city corruption however falter away soon matt reef decides riddler action turn targeting corrupt official anyone everyone including innocent civilian done truly know riddler motif become completely muddled simply fade away generic killer seeking total destruction character film colin farrell penguin criminally underused almost significant role outcome story whether film almost nothing outcome would changed almost film teased character marketing tool promote penguin tv show announced film released farrell performance nonetheless excellent well makeup design character quick mention character zoe kravitz catwoman fine jeffrey wright great officer gordon surprising amount screentime john turturro falcone almost seemed like character unnecessarily took attention away better one like oswald cobblepot batman certainly bad film actually quite enjoyable however serious problem writing severely hinder film thinking david fincher zodiac throughout cryptic puzzle laid riddler incredible darkness cannot help think film worse dark knight worse zodiac want spectacular batman film head christopher nolan direction want cryptic chilling detective film look zodiac,positive,579

"I'm a huge Batman fan. The reviews and the scores given to this movie made me so excited to see it. I honestly was extremely disappointed.

But like a lot of scenes are super slow and just in the plain dark to give you that noir feel. I mean I get it, but to what end? It doesn't help the story, and it doesn't make you feel you're a part of the world, since they don't really develop anything, or even give us an understanding of the locations in Gotham. Its mostly either in the police station or a nightclub. Also, what does Batman add to the story? Catwoman does much better work and appears to have more initiative than Batman in this movie. The Riddler is a joke, and is not menacing at all. The only redeemable villain is Penguin, and we don't get enough of him in the movie. Penguin, Gordon and Catwoman.

"From a technical perspective ""The Batman"" is extremely well done; the photography and the lighting are amazing, action sequences are well coordinated, and there is a different take on stunts, compared to the average superhero flick. DC tried to give an investigative vibe, with a dark tone, very similar to a noir detective story, but they failed. This umpteenth entry of the famous vigilante overcame its welcome with its three hours' length. There were many unnecessary and stretched dialogues, some scenes could be cutted completely, as they did not add any value to the picture. The pace is really slow and I feel that there was no real character development, nor tension buildup. The plot was at times predictable and I could not perceive any kind of danger. There are too many convenient things and Bruce seems to always know exactly what to do or say. We never see him struggling to get the answers, in order to progress with his investigation. Warner Bros. Wanted to aim really high, and I appreciate the effort in doing something different, but this is not David Fincher's ""Se7en"", from which this movie copied a lot of stuff. Unfortunately there is not the same quality nor passion behind this script. Thankfully, I watched it on my TV, from the comfort of my home, so I could take a few breaks here and there. At a certain point it was getting hard to keep going on and I was wondering when this would finally come to an end.Robert Pattinson was not very charismatic or particularly memorable in his performance; especially if we consider that all the people around him did a way better job: Paul Dano portrayed the Riddler wonderfully and he gave a lot of personality to this villain. I really enjoyed this version of the Penguin as a mob criminal, it is a good match and Colin Farrell as always pulled out an amazing acting. The make-up was on point as he was absolutely unrecognizable. Mr. Falcone, played by John Turturro, despite being just a side character with little screen time, was more remarkable than the protagonist. They did not give Alfred and Gordon the importance that they deserved. This is very bad for a movie that is so long, because they had plenty of time to give them more depth. Overall, I am very disappointed, but not surprised. This movie takes itself way too seriously for what it is and this is a very common issue for superheroes products in the latest years. Throwing millions of dollars in special effects and competent photography, using the latest technologies is not enough, if you do not take care of the plot.

"I think this is one of the most booring batman movie. I think the third episode was, with Jim Carrey, and i uderstand the effort to replace that huge mistake, but accidently i cant say this is better.Why?1. Jim Carry much better riddler, than this one.2. Batman caracter there wants to be a comic caracter. Wich i dont like, but at least they did it. Here wants to be a Dark Knight caracter but it become a badly acted copy of that.So i dont know wich is the worst batman movie, but at least that one is not that long to suffer.About the Caracter of Batman. Its a scizofrenic two mental disorded caracter. The rich playboy, with beautifull womens and a company to work, and the masked demon, the angry kid, who want a revenge.In this movie, Bruce Wayne and Batman is a same. An innervated, depressed no one. We didnt see bruce Wayne. The company director. We saw a crow kid, with mental disorder. Same as Batman. NO ACT at all!!!!I give three star
1. For Pinguin and for the last caracter who apear in the movie. (no spoiler)
2. One star for the cameramen, and the effects.3. one star for the costumes (even batman never used that thing on his arm. Probably a bombed arrows, but who know.)Where is the Batman Technologies???? Huge qustions. The batmobile is a ford mustang, with some nitro. Where is the car what can turn to fly, or bike, or subbmarine, or just ride the wall? Batman only use one technologie the spying eye what hi give to catwomen (who is surprisingly good acting) and the climbing rope. Now that one he use most. Actualy all the time. It makes the movie Cheap!No suprise at all. Directoring misstakes, and mistaken storyline. Probably other people lost becouse it has a dead end somewhere in the third part.

"""The Batman"" (2022), just when I thought Hollywood was really running out of ideas and scraping the bottom of the barrel, they make yet another pointless Batman movie. Am I the only one getting sick of these new superhero film attempts? Seriously, most of the excuses of movies nowadays are recycled cash-grabs, and the superhero genre is easily one of the most prominent examples of laziness. ""The Batman"" is the literal definition of lazy. Even the title is not creative! Adding the word, ""The"" to a title, doesn't make it a unique and original movie. Once again, we have another film I didn't see voluntarily. I saw it for free on streaming, and I thought: ""why not? I have some time, I'll give it a fair chance. As long as it doesn't have Henry Cavill pretending to be Superman, or Jason Momoa as Aquaman, or Ben Affleck as Batman, or Ray Fisher as Cyborg and especially if it doesn't have Ezra Miller as The Flash in it!"" Yeah, I'm not a fan of any DC movie after ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy. So, I watched ""The Batman"", and it's exactly how I imagined it would be, in a horrible way. This ""film"" has a poorly paced and dull storyline, average to horrible acting, and a generic cliched soundtrack to try and tie this diarrhea stain together. The plot is, a serial killer starts murdering the key political figures of Gotham City and, you guessed it, Batman has to figure out a way save the day! I will give this ""movie"" some credit, as I always give credit where it's due. The story has a sort of unique premise in the aspect of superhero films. Batman does some extensive detective work and the layout of the plot is treated like a mystery. Had they executed the story properly, it could have been somewhat decent! But no, within the first ten minutes, it falls flat on it's face and it never takes advantage of any possible potential. It's way too dark, the ""movie"" goes on for way too long, the pacing is uneven and it looks like it's trying to win a dumb Academy Award in every shot! Granted, the tone of the character Batman is supposed to be dark and menacing at times. That being said, this ""film"" is so dull and unpleasant that it just comes across as simply depressing. ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy from Christopher Nolan has the perfect balance of dark moments, light hearted moments and drama. They knew when to be serious, they knew when to throw in a comedic line and they knew when to add in the heavy scenes that resonate with me and other people today. Those three movies had a cohesive balance between different genres! ""The Batman"" does not, it's just dark, dull, with occasional action and fight scenes in an attempt to create some form of entertainment. It's the ""entertaining"" part I'm questioning. Such a shame, at nearly three hours in length, there is next to nothing salvageable in this ""film"" at all! As for the acting, it's overall really horrible from the whole entire cast! None of them look like they're trying at all. When you look in their eyes, you don't see actors/actresses. You just see a bunch of people eagerly awaiting their paychecks! Although, Robert Pattison is a better Bruce Wayne/Batman than Ben Affleck, which isn't saying much, as Ben Affleck is one of the worst actors to ever portray the character! One thing that is an improvement over the DC movies after ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, is the design of this Batman outfit. It's a lot better than the one that Ben Affleck wore! But, it's still not as good as the one Christian Bale wore in the Christopher Nolan films. Robert Pattison does have potential to be a good Batman, but this poorly written script prevented him from giving it his all. As far as the soundtrack goes, it's about as generic as they come. Once again, we have a terrible film score written by a great movie composer, Michael Giacchino. It does have some decent parts here and there. But overall, it's nothing to write home about. That's pretty bad, because most of the music he writes for movies is phenomenal! What happened to him here? Any way, why don't we go ahead and move on to the only two good elements in this pile of crap. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. It really gives you the feeling of being in Gotham City! The lighting is cool, and gives the sets a dramatic feel. That being said, it's also a problem, because that's the tone they stick with from beginning to end and it adds nothing to this ""movie""! As far as the special effects go, they are well-done and still hold up today. Which is no surprise, being released in 2022! ""The Batman"" is yet another pointless superhero film that no one asked for. I know I didn't! The pacing is way too slow and for the majority of the time, nothing happens. Is it the worst superhero movie I've ever seen? Absolutely not, there are many that I consider to be much worse than this one. But it's still, by my high standards, a terrible film. I'm struggling to give this ""movie"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Unless you have nothing to do and need to kill three hours of your time, I highly recommend skipping this waste of a ""film"". Really, there are so many other great and beneficial things to do in life. Why waste it on a poorly executed superhero movie? But seriously, how many times can they possibly rehash the same concept over and over again? Maybe one day, Hollywood will get bored with the superhero genre and try to make something else! But, with the way things are nowadays, I'm not getting my hopes up.

"Not a big Marvel/DC Universe fanboy---but the darkness and the allure of the original backstory of the Batman was one from my youth and continued through the Nolan Trilogy. As good as the Nolan films were, they were almost too ""big"" for the scale of the character; dark, vengeful, introverted. Where Nolans films may have missed, Reeves delivers...and boy does he.This is dark and brooding catnip for this long standing established Batman fan..though the timeline was skewed to allow a very important character seemingly ommited. It's easy to get past with Danos spectacularly portrayed Riddler. Dano nails it in the third act as he is unmasked and the creepiness and acting skills come out in full force, which, I almost wish his character was unmasked earlier---just to see his incredible acting skill come out from behind the shroud of obscurity.As for Pattinson, I had my doubts, and not because of his acting skill level, but moreso his physical presence. That was literally erased the first sequence of him fully suited and mowing through anyone that stood in his way.Watch this without distraction and dimly lit to help capture what Reeves delivers on. Powerful script with a few miniscule eye rolls, mostly to hokiness, but not enough to slow the machine down. 8.5 stars.",big marvel dc universe fanboy darkness allure original backstory batman one youth continued nolan trilogy good nolan film almost big scale character dark vengeful introverted nolans film may missed reef delivers boy dark brooding catnip long standing established batman fan though timeline skewed allow important character seemingly ommited easy get past danos spectacularly portrayed riddler dano nail third act unmasked creepiness acting skill come full force almost wish character unmasked earlier see incredible acting skill come behind shroud obscurity pattinson doubt acting skill level moreso physical presence literally erased first sequence fully suited mowing anyone stood way watch without distraction dimly lit help capture reef delivers powerful script miniscule eye roll mostly hokiness enough slow machine star,positive,598
"After fortunately being able to watch this film at an early screening, the enormous amount of anticipation I had for this film was fulfilled from beginning to end. Providing deep character introspections that delve into the psyche of each character proves not only to be respectful but fresh despite the number of interpretations that have been previously portrayed. Passion is present through each frame of the camera, creating a horrific, melancholic, and meditative look at the scenery and the actors portraying their characters. It gives the film an emotional angle, that is not just spoken through words, but the powerful nature of a brilliant combination of director and actor. The cast is beyond amazing through their interpretations of their characters, delivering dialogue in a poignant way while also being able to convey emotions speechlessly.

"To be honest, this is a really good movie. Hang on? So why did I only give it 2 out of 5 stars? Well, this is really personal but, to me, it is not a good Batman movie. I really had problems writing this review because it is a very good movie. I just did not like it as a Batman movie.The movie is really dark, gritty and noir. Not really a problem. It works for some movies. But it is also quite slow at the beginning and the first quarter of the movie was actually boring. Remember, this is a three hour movie so a quarter is more than half an hour of ""boringness"".The ""boringess"" was broken up by a pretty cool car chase. Some people seem to not really like the batmobile and I have to say that it was not very inspired but it was not all bad either. Unfortunately the movie turned rather boring for a while again after that.The movie tries to bring out more of the detective part of Batman than the previous movies, which is fine, but there is just too much moping around with Batman / Bruce Wayne walking around oozing sadness all around him.Actually, this brings us to my main gripe with this movie. The choice of actor for the Batman is just wrong for me. He is more like a sad puppy than the Batman. The script that makes him mope around, have emotional outbreaks and, occasionally, being downright stupid like just staring dumbfounded when explosives go off in his face does not really help of course.To me the Selina Kyle character had more charisma than the Batman, especially when the Batman was in his Bruce Wayne alter ego.And I really, really dislike that twist about Bruce's parents. That was such a lazy Hollywood writer hack thing to do just to create (unwanted) drama.Then we have the Riddler. Compared to the charismatic villains that we have come to expect he is just a sad little psychopath with a bunch of equally sad fanatical internet followers.Now, all of this would have worked great if it had been a movie about some, unspecified, vigilante. The movie is really well done. The detective story, the action (especially towards the end) and the noir setting would have worked great. Even at its three hour bloated length it would have been great although cut down to two hours or a bit more would have been even better.

"What is the one thing that Bane or Darkseid or Deathstroke failed and Robert Pattinson succeeded in doing?'KILL THE BATMAN'Even with the storyline of the film and the super noir theme coming closest to the actual comic books, Pattinson fails to create the Cape Crusader aura big time.The story depicts year two of Batman's crime fighting in Gotham, with the dark knight portrayed more of a detective than a superhero, deep diving into his early years.. still the appearance, physique, voice, too much talking and ponderous dialogues, showing bollywood like emotions and a hell lot of public appearances (in bat costume) defies the whole identity of Batman.Apart from that the movie is a 3 hour marathon, things moving soooooo slow around Batman, (maybe the first superhero movie ever when I yawned), Riddler (who by the way was very good) was scarcely used, Penguin was more of a filler, Catwoman got so much screentime but they didn't venture into her character.. tbh the only character that stood out would be Carmine Falcone.. and that is just sad..There were some welcome action sequences, but again the Batmobil was a biggggggg disappointment.P.

And can anyone please tell me why when presenting the weakest most depressed emo Batman ever (getting knocked out multiple times) people go rave about it? Lucky no one snatched his mask when being passed out over and over again.I really wanted to like the movie but come on, that wasn't Batman. But a cliche film-noir take on a guy dressed in something resembling a bat costume solving who's the rat. Did you notice the flimsy bat mask when he removed it?Boring and weak story, who cares about predictable stories about corrupt policemen and mafia bosses...same old boring story. Go watch The Wire instead.So can somebody please help me explain why this movie is over hyped considering this list of weak points?1. Such lazy story writing: The wool cat hat (pointy ears) woman was the best friend of the key person Batman was looking for. How convenient...an insult to us viewers not buying the over the top too convenient plot.2. Depressed weak Batman that gets knocked out multiple times. Scared of heights?! And he's suppose to be The Batman?3. Silly booster syringe, why didn't Batman use that drug all the time?4. Lazy story writing: Discovering the map under the carpet because a random police man's father worked in the carpet industry. If it wasn't for the police man's father's career Batman would never had discover the map.5. Batman would not know about the bombs if the random police man's father didn't work in the carpet industry. How convenient, lazy screenplay.6. How could the crucial bombs just be side story!? It should have been the main mission for weak Batman to discover and stop! At least that would make a much more exciting story line to follow than ""who's the rat"" repeating it self for about 3 hours straight...7. No one stopped the lady major from going through with her public arrangement, after the bombs went off. Even with both Batman and Gordon present.8. The Riddle guy getting unrealistically too much screen time during news broadcasts.9. No tech, only eye camera lenses. Come on, Batman is the king of gadgets.10. Boring snoring story about mafia bosses and corrupt policemen, why care about the story when there's no emotional connection to something so obvious? Meaning there was no redemptive aspect presented to none of the bad guys. No hope for change nor development. Just about who's the rat. So why care?11. The ""who's the rat"" got boring and repetitive real fast. The penguin? The Batman? The falcon guy?12. Story going in circles, The Who's the rat theme.13. The Riddle had his apartment just next door to the mafia guy's house, basically on floor level and blind Batman never discovered it with his binoculars?14. Why did Batman have to spray his whole living room floor to crack the riddle when he had an advanced computer in his cave? It was hilarious though watching him struggle pushing his living room table while grunting. Once again weak Batman, he must be struggling when vacuuming moving his furnitures...15. Wool hat cat woman's relationship with both her mafia father and depressed weak Batman had no emotional arch. Boring and un engaging. When they kissed the only thing I could notice was the composer struggling to over-sell the moment with too much strings.16. And finally: When Batman cut the power chord falling in slow motion to something that looked like real danger, I actually hoped Batman would drown and die. I couldn't care less. But no, popping out of the water simply pushing a steel beam to save the drowning people, then to have them casually swim after him...17. Bonus point: The film's conclusion seemed to be written by a 12 year old. ""Revenge isn't all good, people also need help."" Quote ""The Batman"", bravo.Save your money, turn off your light and watch a CSI Miami episode instead.

"The movie could've easily been 1.5 to 2 hours long. Lots of slow pointless scenes that just drag on and on. I don't understand how this movie has an 8.1/10 rating. It's baffling how overhyped this movie is. Bruce Wayne is supposed to be crazy rich, yet he appears to be struggling, financially.

"First off, this movie is NOT a Batman movie, it is a detective/serial killer ""who done it"" movie that has race-swapped versions of certain characters in the Batman Universe and features Batman and other characters from The Batman Universe. But too many liberties were taken with everything.The old Batman show was campy, but had fun and charm. The Keaton Batman movies are amazing. The Nolan Batman movies (all three of them) were really good and awesome. The animated movies, we will forget about the 90's ones after Michael Keaton left the role!Now, you have Robert Pattinson as the Batman/Bruce Wayne. I think it was not him that was the problem, it was what he was given to work with. He spends the entire movie with a ""I have never laughed before and might cry soon"" face. I know people type-cast him as ""That guy from Twilight"", but he has shown he can act in other movies. I think, given the right direction, he would make a very good Batman. He just overdid the ""Dark, brooding"" quality Batman has and was too serious at both roles. Christian Bale did it much better and had a ton more contrast with Batman vs. Bruce Wayne.We have ZoÃ« Kravitz as Selena Kyle/Catwoman, apparently they ran out of white blonde women to play her in Hollywood? That said, she looks good and played the part fine, even though I have never seen anyone that determined to find out what happened to their friend!One big issue ism my family and I had to hear the line where she thanks the Riddler for killing ""all these white privileged a-holes"", which was uncalled for in a Batman movie! It is okay for the Riddler to kill said people, yet he is the alleged bad guy? That line, after being bored and the other issues, nearly made me stop watching this. My five year old daughter asked me what that was supposed to mean, and I was not happy having to make something up for that stupid line. Not sure what they were thinking but there is enough of that elsewhere!Jeffrey Wright, another race swap, did just okay as James Gordon. While I think he is a good actor, he is the same as in Westworld and every other movie/show I have see him in. Gary Oldman was the best and definitive movie version, but why they race swapped the characters is beyond me.Paul Dano has a unique look and could have been a great choice as The Riddler. Instead, he seemed like the Joker with a garbage bag over his head. I cannot for the life of me figure out what Matt Reeves was thinking. He should have looked and acted a lot more like the Dark Knight PC/PS4/Xbox One game. With better material, he could have really done something.Andy Serkis did not work for me as Alfred. Michael Caine and Michael Gough were much better in the role. Serkis is awesome, but they did not give him enough. In the end he seems like just a plot device to give Bruce Wayne/Batman motivation to solve who the Riddler is.The Penguin was a big anomaly, I could not even recognize Colin Farrell! The fact he was more like a scared thug than a villain was a weird liberty, he did have some of the only funny lines in the movie though.The action scenes were pretty good, seen better and worse. The new Batmobile was incredible, I give them that. Gotham did not look like Gotham to me, it looks like a city with Gotham signs thrown into it. Nolan went for realism, but I liked his Gotham better than this. They can ride motorcycles in full speed with constant rain!The plot is what actually sucks, boring, too long, and they could have told the same story while cutting a whole hour out. It is like you spend the whole movie waiting for something to happen, but it never happens.They did make Batman more a detective, which was more like the comic version, but the beginning of the movie starts out awkward and never loses that. Matt Reeves could have done much better.A better plot, better direction, no race swapping, and not taking so many liberties with everything could have made this a very good Batman reboot. Instead, we got a snooze fest that could have been it's own movie without parts of the Batman Universe in it.",first movie batman movie detective serial killer done movie race swapped version certain character batman universe feature batman character batman universe many liberty taken everything old batman show campy fun charm keaton batman movie amazing nolan batman movie three really good awesome animated movie forget one michael keaton left role robert pattinson batman bruce wayne think problem given work spends entire movie never laughed might cry soon face know people type cast guy twilight shown act movie think given right direction would make good batman overdid dark brooding quality batman serious role christian bale much better ton contrast batman v bruce wayne zo kravitz selena kyle catwoman apparently ran white blonde woman play hollywood said look good played part fine even though never seen anyone determined find happened friend one big issue ism family hear line thanks riddler killing white privileged hole uncalled batman movie okay riddler kill said people yet alleged bad guy line bored issue nearly made stop watching five year old daughter asked supposed mean happy make something stupid line sure thinking enough elsewhere jeffrey wright another race swap okay james gordon think good actor westworld every movie show see gary oldman best definitive movie version race swapped character beyond paul dano unique look could great choice riddler instead seemed like joker garbage bag head cannot life figure matt reef thinking looked acted lot like dark knight pc p xbox one game better material could really done something andy serkis work alfred michael caine michael gough much better role serkis awesome give enough end seems like plot device give bruce wayne batman motivation solve riddler penguin big anomaly could even recognize colin farrell fact like scared thug villain weird liberty funny line movie though action scene pretty good seen better worse new batmobile incredible give gotham look like gotham look like city gotham sign thrown nolan went realism liked gotham better ride motorcycle full speed constant rain plot actually suck boring long could told story cutting whole hour like spend whole movie waiting something happen never happens make batman detective like comic version beginning movie start awkward never loses matt reef could done much better better plot better direction race swapping taking many liberty everything could made good batman reboot instead got snooze fest could movie without part batman universe,positive,612
"This movie is probably the best depiction of a very young Batman so far.I was intrigued by the crime, the mystery, and the use of the underworld as a plot driver. The film was dark and gritty, and it held that mood throughout. I can see why some viewers might not love that, but I enjoyed kind of plunging into the dark and twisted parts of Gotham and if it has been light, bright, and happy, it would've been pretty disingenuous.Furthermore, the cinematography was perfect emphasising the role of each character especially our dark knight, also the soundtrack which helped the audience to merge into this dramatic world.The thing is many people seems to forget that in addition to fighting crime with his fists and high-tech gadgets, Batman is also an accomplished detective. His strategy of using stealth to sneak around for clues as well as his superior powers of deduction are rivalled only by the likes of Sherlock Holmes. Unfortunately, this quirk hasn't really been touched upon in past movies, instead focusing on the action-based aspects of the character, likely because most casual audiences would find these moments more fun to watch. That is, of course, until now.Conclusion: You may or may not like it as a movie, but it is a fact that we have watched ""A Great Batman and a Great Bruce Wayne"".",movie probably best depiction young batman far intrigued crime mystery use underworld plot driver film dark gritty held mood throughout see viewer might love enjoyed kind plunging dark twisted part gotham light bright happy would pretty disingenuous furthermore cinematography perfect emphasising role character especially dark knight also soundtrack helped audience merge dramatic world thing many people seems forget addition fighting crime fist high tech gadget batman also accomplished detective strategy using stealth sneak around clue well superior power deduction rivalled like sherlock holmes unfortunately quirk really touched upon past movie instead focusing action based aspect character likely casual audience would find moment fun watch course conclusion may may like movie fact watched great batman great bruce wayne,positive,613

"I was underwhelmed by this iteration of the multiple versions of Batman. Pattinson functioned more like a sullen teenager in search of his identity than a confident billionaire. The plot ran like a procedural crime investigation rather than an action packed thrill ride. Even Penguin and Riddler were toned down behind masks or gads of prosthetic make up. (I admit Danny DeVito's Penguin is etched permanently in my mind).Zoe Kravitz plays a serious Catwoman devoid of catty pranks. I do have to say, the fact Batman never went away with her always made me sad. Forget Gotham, you big dumb lug!Perhaps the biggest fail was the complete and total lack of humor. I had to wait all the way to the end of three long hours to have Paul Dano finally make me laugh. Go see it and maybe you will enjoy it.

"Spoiler free thoughts on The Batman.It sucks.Oh? You want details? Here goes...In life, music and art light and shade are important. This lesson has not been heeded here. This is a one-note movie. It is unrelentingly dark both in tone and in visuals. It's almost impossible to see any detail of anything ever. This darkness can be brilliant when used well, however if the only crayon in your colouring box is black you have a problem.One example of this is Batman movies typically show Bruce Wayne a fair amount. This is needed to make Batman feel like a real person. Bruce Wayne gets about 3 minutes of screen time here. This Batman is utterly one dimensional. This leads me neatly to...Robert Pattinson, as I suspected, cannot (or possibly did not) act. He plays the tiny handful of scenes as Bruce Wayne like a petulant teenager. He's morose, surly like an Emo version of Harry Enfield's Kevin character. When he's Batman he moves well and is quite imposing but the suit's doing all the heavy lifting.The fight scenes are ok. That's about it really. They're ok. There's no sense of jeopardy really. The Batsuit appears impervious to guns, knives, bombs, falling off tall buildings etc.The one car chase is dull and rather pointless. The omnipresent dark tone means you never see the Batmobile properly or the Batbike. Which leads to...Collateral damage is rampant and Batman doesn't give a hoot. All the other iterations of Batman have shown concern for innocents caught up in the violence that occurs while he's fighting crime. This Batman is about as concerned as a US President ordering a drone strike.Andy Serkis is wasted as Alfred.Phone call for Jeffrey Wright. It's Gary Oldman calling. He wants his performance as Jim Gordon back. He only said you could borrow it, not steal it.The Riddler never has a single plausible reason for his actions presented. Nor is his ability to do the things he does ever explored or explained. He's just the McGuffin to hang a lot of Bat activity onto. If you want him to be a motiveless loony like Heath Ledger's magnificent Joker then you need both a better actor and more time to let him BE that character.Colin Farrell as Penguin? Why? What was the point? He's not significant enough of a character in the film to make the hours of prosthetics worthwhile. He's OK I suppose but no great shakes. He doesn't get to do very much except copy Robert De Niro's turn as Al Capone in The Untouchables.Is there one good thing?Yes. ZoÃ« Kravitz as Catwoman. Shes outstanding. She's a believable, three dimensional character. You care about who she is and why she does what she does. The next Batman movie needs to star her as Catwoman and have Batman as a very secondary supporting character.I think that's about it.Anyhoo. If you enjoyed it then I'm happy for you. We all like different things and obviously all the above is just my opinion not the cold hard facts.",spoiler free thought batman suck oh want detail go life music art light shade important lesson heeded one note movie unrelentingly dark tone visuals almost impossible see detail anything ever darkness brilliant used well however crayon colouring box black problem one example batman movie typically show bruce wayne fair amount needed make batman feel like real person bruce wayne get minute screen time batman utterly one dimensional lead neatly robert pattinson suspected cannot possibly act play tiny handful scene bruce wayne like petulant teenager morose surly like emo version harry enfield kevin character batman move well quite imposing suit heavy lifting fight scene ok really ok sense jeopardy really batsuit appears impervious gun knife bomb falling tall building etc one car chase dull rather pointless omnipresent dark tone mean never see batmobile properly batbike lead collateral damage rampant batman give hoot iteration batman shown concern innocent caught violence occurs fighting crime batman concerned u president ordering drone strike andy serkis wasted alfred phone call jeffrey wright gary oldman calling want performance jim gordon back said could borrow steal riddler never single plausible reason action presented ability thing ever explored explained mcguffin hang lot bat activity onto want motiveless loony like heath ledger magnificent joker need better actor time let character colin farrell penguin point significant enough character film make hour prosthetics worthwhile ok suppose great shake get much except copy robert de niro turn al capone untouchable one good thing yes zo kravitz catwoman shes outstanding believable three dimensional character care next batman movie need star catwoman batman secondary supporting character think anyhoo enjoyed happy like different thing obviously opinion cold hard fact,positive,618
"Cons-
My biggest problem with the movie is the horrible miscast for every major character. Especially, Alfred (who is barely in the movie) feels lost and Falcone doesn't feel intimidating.The movie could be edited to remove atleast 40-50 minutes and nothing would change. Some scenes were stretched for too long and some just had boring dialogues that kept on repeating.The plot isn't very great or new. There are many movies out there like this, this one just has a costumed guy. The payoff at the end wasn't worth the 2.5 hour buildupThey wanted to keep things in real world but sometimes they don't follow it. Two people take close range blasts and survive. Batman walking close to cops and getting photographed (his biggest thing is his secret identity), like who wouldn't recognise him.Also on other note, it is also not a movie made for theatres, too many flashing lights and rest is pitch black.",con biggest problem movie horrible miscast every major character especially alfred barely movie feel lost falcone feel intimidating movie could edited remove atleast minute nothing would change scene stretched long boring dialogue kept repeating plot great new many movie like one costumed guy payoff end worth hour buildupthey wanted keep thing real world sometimes follow two people take close range blast survive batman walking close cop getting photographed biggest thing secret identity like recognise also note also movie made theatre many flashing light rest pitch black,positive,619

"I'm mystified by the amount of people who have found this to be a ""masterpiece"".The first thing to address is the interminable length. Quite honestly I would have found it a chore at half the runtime but it became like slow torture, seemingly intent on shredding my last nerve! I dread to think what was left on the cutting room floor, let's hope they never do a director's cut.The pace is relentlessly turgid, interspersed with brief bouts of action. They lose much of their impact, however, due to the impenetrable gloom that pervades the entire film. I've never before seen anything like it. One almost completely dark scene follows another. There's no texture, no highs & lows, no expectation of tension or differentiation of mood or pace.Add into that sorry mix the acting. Robert Pattinson is woefully miscast as he lacks any kind of gravitas or presence. Instead he comes across as a sulky brat throwing his toys out the pram. Admittedly the script is so bad he didn't have a great deal to work with but not all the blame lies there. He doesn't have maturity to portray such a complex character as Bruce Wayne, he's not got the charisma needed. Christian Bale he most definitely is not!No-one in this film rises above the level of a two dimensional cutout. For that both the scriptwriter & the director must be held accountable. Somewhere in mix is the kernel of a fresh take on the Batman story, unfortunately it was killed stone dead by both of them.Nolan & Bale's Batman was, admittedly, a hard act to follow but the viewing public deserved far better than this. I don't know if there are any sequels planned but I'm not enough of a masochist to bother finding out.So be warned, avoid this at all costs!

"Full Disclosure: I'm a huge Batman fan. I would say that the three movies by Christopher Nolan are probably my three favorite movies of all time, and that the three Arkham games are probably my three favorite videogames ever. So of course, I was extremely hyped for this movie, which also means that there was a big chance of me getting disappointed. And sadly, it was the case. Hopefully, it was just the hype, and my review will change after future viewings, which I think is really possible, especially after reading other reviews and seeing how most people loved it. But anyway, this is my review after watching the film for the first time:Being a big fan of detective thrillers, like Se7en and Prisoners, I was really on board with the tone and story The Batman was going for. Also, I liked the idea of a dark and realistic Batman but with a more ""comic book feel"" than the Bale movies. And even when the movie mostly succeeds in the tone, I thought it failed story wise.First, the movie tries too hard to develop too many characters and story lines, which makes it hard to stay invested on any of them. Sometimes, I felt that when I was finally getting intrigued by the Riddler storyline, the movie switched to focus on the Penguin or Falcone, and vice versa. In some ways, the movie makes the same mistakes Spiderman 3 did, introducing too many characters and storylines, interrupting you from getting griped.Second, even when we spent a ton of time with many characters, it feels like the movie doesn't spend enough with Bruce Wayne. I agree with not showing again the same origin story we´ve seen too many times but I think the movie should stay a little more time with Bruce Wayne, letting the audience get more attached to the character, so the movie can have a bigger emotional impact, even when he is dressed as Batman. Sadly, even being a 3-hour movie, The Batman, doesn't seem to spend enough time with its main character. In regards of Pattison's performance, I thought he was ok, but not even close to Bale.Finally, in what comes to the ending (no spoilers, but you can skip this part if you want to have no idea) the movie doesn't deliver the impactful finale that it seemed it was trying too hard preparing. The plot twist we were all waiting on the end, never comes, and the final battle is just Batman taking down some thugs, in a context that feels a bit over the top
In conclusion, The Batman could have been great, but sadly it isn't. The ""Se7en"" tone, the cast, and the cinematography got me hopping this would be the new Dark Knight. Unfortunately, the movie tries to do too much for just one movie, never letting you get totally invested, and leaving you with an ending that makes the whopping 3 hours feel not seem worth it.",full disclosure huge batman fan would say three movie christopher nolan probably three favorite movie time three arkham game probably three favorite videogames ever course extremely hyped movie also mean big chance getting disappointed sadly case hopefully hype review change future viewing think really possible especially reading review seeing people loved anyway review watching film first time big fan detective thriller like se en prisoner really board tone story batman going also liked idea dark realistic batman comic book feel bale movie even movie mostly succeeds tone thought failed story wise first movie try hard develop many character story line make hard stay invested sometimes felt finally getting intrigued riddler storyline movie switched focus penguin falcone vice versa way movie make mistake spiderman introducing many character storyline interrupting getting griped second even spent ton time many character feel like movie spend enough bruce wayne agree showing origin story seen many time think movie stay little time bruce wayne letting audience get attached character movie bigger emotional impact even dressed batman sadly even hour movie batman seem spend enough time main character regard pattison performance thought ok even close bale finally come ending spoiler skip part want idea movie deliver impactful finale seemed trying hard preparing plot twist waiting end never come final battle batman taking thug context feel bit top conclusion batman could great sadly se en tone cast cinematography got hopping would new dark knight unfortunately movie try much one movie never letting get totally invested leaving ending make whopping hour feel seem worth,positive,629

"I'll begin this review by giving some context:
1. I am moderately interested in superhero films, but have never read a comic book
2. I have seen most Batman films (all Keaton, Kilmer, Clooney and Bale)
3. We decided to watch this as a couple for 'date night'. My wife is definitely not into superheroes.Overview:
The film really didn't feel very superhero-y and was more like a grungey, post-apocalyptic serial killer whodunnit (of sorts). Off the top of my head, sort of Se7en meets The Crow. Even though it's three hours, we did it in one sitting as it kept us gripped and wanting more.Pros:
The serial killer stuff is equal parts scary, gory and interestingThere are lots of actors who you'll recognise - as well as some very famous who you may not - who do actually get killed off (it makes you feel that nobody is really 'safe')There is a nice balance between expecting you to know stuff about the Batman universe in advance and notIt crams a lot in! (Batman, Catwoman, Penguin, Riddler, Joker, Capt. Gordon, Alfred etc.)It is a completely different take on the character and the context but I quite liked it. In this one you could at least understand why nobody would suspect this Bruce Wayne of being Batman.It was more 'realistic' than a lot of superhero films and felt like it existed in a version of New York in the not-too-distant futureCons:
At nearly three hours, it's long!The ending was a tad anti-climacticThe CGI was somewhat questionable in a number of partsThe 'flying squirrel' sequence was just strangeThere are a lot of POV shots (e.g. Riding a motorbike) which feel a bit like a video game and are jarringIt's a horrible one, but unfortunately Robert Pattison doesn't look like Batman. For a Batman who is so bareknuckle in his fighting style, you really needed a bulkier version of the character.Overall, it's worth a go, even if these kinds of thing typically aren't your bag. It'll be interesting to see where they'll go next as this film sets up so many potential avenues to explore in the future. Even though it's a chunky 3 hours, it moves along nicely and covers a lot of ground in that time in terms of world-building and character-establishing.

"I'm going to be honest I did not have high expectations for this film. I have my gripes with all the adaptations not just this one.Let me just say (for those that haven't read the comics) it really is the most faithful adaptation to date, as a detective film noir and played as more of a thriller with some action thrown in - but even the visuals - I mean Gotham City looks and feels like it unlike any film before. Robert Pattinson is Batman/Bruce Wayne and he grows towards the end into as close to the caped crusader as one could hope. He doesn't quite nail the billionaire playboy philanthropist alter ego of Bruce Wayne in this film but something tells me that is why the movie is called The Batman - because the sequels will give the character a chance to evolve.Jeffrey Wright plays Jim Gordon and he plays it very well, Zoe Kravitz is excellent and sassy as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Paul Dano is incredible as The Riddler (especially at the end when you see him unmasked - what a phenomenal scene it is), and also unrecognisable is Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin - who while brief is absolutely mind-blowing with the few minutes screen time he has. I wasn't entirely sure on Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth but I did like him, I guess I had always pictured Alfred as much older - unfortunately he isn't in the film as much as one would hope to get a good feel of his character, I hope they rectify that with the sequel.A lot of people are screaming about how the cast was race-swapped - I don't know and I don't care, everyone pulled off great performances, some with very little they had and they felt very much like the characters from the comics so I can kind of brush it aside. I mean Harvey Dent was race-swapped in the original Batman (1989) and nobody seemed to mind there.As for the best Batman I appreciate it is subjective. I have a soft spot for Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns as I grew up with them. The major selling point is Gotham City - this is Batman's world, the city has to feel like an extension of him, and it has to draw me in,So if I am going to compare it to anything it would be Batman Begins - I would say it is better - but only just. It is a lot darker, much grittier, akin to the movie Se7en with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, the Batmobile is done well and feels like an extension of Batman and his rage and the score by Michael Giacchino is epic and worth a listen! And I thought Danny Elfman's and Hans Zimmer's were great in their own way.The film is incredible and I urge you all to see it on the big screen.

"I was initially curious to see how Robert Pattinson would fit as the ""new"" Batman, but I don't know what they were trying to achieve with him cause I got some serious Twilight vibes, and that ain't good.It seems that Batman is some edgy emo kid now and on top of that they also portray his character in a really weird and creepy way when he's interacting with Catwoman, which really threw me off cause I don't know why they would ever do that with a character like Batman, that alone is what took 5 points off.The story is also another convoluted mess that seems to be trying too hard, way too little action and way too many dragged out scenes, the acting was passable, no one really stood out, and the music score was maybe a bit too much at times for what was actually happening on screen, but otherwise it was ok.Now to ""The Batman"" himself, he's like a shell of what he should be, gadgets are basically nonexistent and he's now driving a road car...they didn't even try to add anything new or interesting, if anything they went backwards.Honestly, it never felt like I was watching a Batman movie, rather a caricature of himself.",initially curious see robert pattinson would fit new batman know trying achieve cause got serious twilight vibe good seems batman edgy emo kid top also portray character really weird creepy way interacting catwoman really threw cause know would ever character like batman alone took point story also another convoluted mess seems trying hard way little action way many dragged scene acting passable one really stood music score maybe bit much time actually happening screen otherwise ok batman like shell gadget basically nonexistent driving road car even try add anything new interesting anything went backwards honestly never felt like watching batman movie rather caricature,positive,637

Kravitz also downplayed the character of Catwoman. Wright's part as James Gordon was almost invisible. I could not care for these characters and so did not care what happened to them. Even the crises seemed phoned in. I just could not get excited with this Batdom foray.

"This is the worst comic book movie I have ever tried to watch. This film makes those Zack Snyder DC films seem like oscar worthy contenders. That's how much of a dumpster fire within a dumpster fire known as the DCEU is. It took me like 3 or 4 days to watch the movie as it's a slog that lacks direction. It can't decide if it wants to be an origin film or not. The film is a try hard wannabe with its gritty, teenaged angst style, which a lot of people seem to think gritty = realistic. It does not.If going with a realistic take on Batman, you cant have him be completely immune to bullets and a bomb going off inches away from his face without any visible injuries. Immediately following the bomb to his face, he flies into a bridge while wearing a wing suit and isn't injured whatsoever. The director, Matt Reeves, doesn't understand that body armor doesn't make someone invulnerable to harm and being shot at pointblank range, and that bullets just don't bounce of body armor like throwing ping pong balls at someone. A person wearing body armor will be severely injured or dead if shot 100 times at pointblank range. No person would intentionally walk into a hail of bullets. Especially, not Batman. In this film he does. In all the Batman comics, Batman tries to avoid being shot and when he is shot, the comics illustrate that he, like most humans, is injured from being shot. Batman also devises multiple plans before he goes to deal with the bad guys in. He just doesn't blindly go into bad guy territory without a plan. Batman is not SupermanBatman doesn't knock on doors and politely ask to speak to a villain. In this movie he does repeatedly. It's unintentionally funny. Batman tries to avoid directly harming innocent people at all costs. In this film, he has no problem with causing direct harm to people like in that car chase scene. Like at least 20 people on the road during that scene were killed because of Batman's idiotic idea to chase the Penguin down a busy highway. This Batman doesn't know how to fight. He just flails around throwing punches randomly. In the comics, Batman is an expert in various fighting and self-defense fighting styles.Matt Reeves doesn't understand the dichotomy of Batman and Bruce Wayne. In the comics, Bruce Wayne and Batman aren't depicted as the same personality. Bruce Wayne is a cool, charming, caring, highly intelligent guy that's also a playboy at times. In this movie, Bruce Wayne is an angsty, emo entitled cardboard cutout brat. There's one scene where he tells Alfred, that Alfred isn't his real daddy and then presumably goes and has a cry in the corner. Like WTF lol? In this movie, Batman is an unintelligent guy that needs his butler and the police to solve simple riddles or cryptic notes left by the Riddler. There is no detective work in this film. Batman/Bruce Wayne looks like he's strung out on heroin and hasn't ate a good meal in months. He's like 150 lbs in this film and has track marks. Edgy.There is zero character development in this movie despite it's 3 hours runtime. Every character is just a one dimensional, cardboard cutout. The Penguin should've been cut from the movie as his one dimensional story doesn't add anything to the one dimensional story. The Riddler disappears from the movie for over an hour and he's a generic serial killer that changes his master plan to an even more generic plot point of flooding the city. The romance between Batman and Catwoman isn't remotely believable as Robert Pattinson and Zoe Kravitz have zero chemistry. God such a dumpster fire of a movie. Robert Pattinson was clearly phoning it in, in this film. He even refused to workout indicating how little he gives a crap about this film. It's a high paying paycheck for him.There's so much more wrong with this dumpster fire. DC/WB stop letting your directors write the story too.

"For 3 hours, I was on the edge of my seat absolutely enthralled by what I was watching on screen. The layers and interconnectivity to this story are incredible and make it a supremely rewarding viewing experience.Pattinson nails the role and brings some real emotion and vulnerability like we haven't seen before from this character. His arc in the film feels earned and genuine. The depiction of Gotham as this grimy, seedy world is the best we've seen yet on film and I felt completely transported. I loved the dark, nihilistic tone and The Riddler's serial killer-like persona was captivating. Just because there aren't forced jokes every 10 seconds like in an MCU film doesn't mean there isn't humor. There was plenty of humor, it was just dry and more subtle.Giacchino might have crafted the most perfect Batman score I've ever heard. I cannot get it out of my head. The scene where the Batmobile revs up was an unforgettable moment in the theater and the subsequent car chase was one of the most intense action scenes I've seen in years. The scene with Riddler talking to Batman about Bruce Wayne was jaw-dropping in its masterful design.

"While at points it might actually be the best DC movie since the middle of Nolan's trilogy, The Batman still falls some way short of a satisfying film, failing completely to put any characters onscreen we can like or care about, and at three hours is much, much, much too long.Batman as a depressed emo teenager was an odd creative choice, but at least he looks good. Bruce Wayne, on the other hand, is a complete cipher, just a walking blank space, with no emotions, no life, no fun. A recluse, he hardly looks like the billionaire playboy he'd need to be to fool the world. He basically behaves exactly the same as Batman when in public but without the mask. That's quite a big oversight.The redefining of The Riddler as something much more scary and dangerous is an interesting development, but it feels a little too reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker. A few more jokes would have helped strengthen the character. And that goes for the movie, too.There's a few unnecessary racial comments in the film - not a lot, but enough to leave a bad taste in the mouth.Decent acting all round, with a grown-up detective thriller vibe (reminiscent of ""Se7en""), along with nice photography and atmosphere, but it's all just so absurdly implausible and relentlessly dull, with only about 10 minutes of good action to liven it up, and nothing of any further substance underneath.",point might actually best dc movie since middle nolan trilogy batman still fall way short satisfying film failing completely put character onscreen like care three hour much much much long batman depressed emo teenager odd creative choice least look good bruce wayne hand complete cipher walking blank space emotion life fun recluse hardly look like billionaire playboy need fool world basically behaves exactly batman public without mask quite big oversight redefining riddler something much scary dangerous interesting development feel little reminiscent heath ledger joker joke would helped strengthen character go movie unnecessary racial comment film lot enough leave bad taste mouth decent acting round grown detective thriller vibe reminiscent se en along nice photography atmosphere absurdly implausible relentlessly dull minute good action liven nothing substance underneath,positive,650

Pattinson does a good enough job as Batman. I like the dark detective and more menacing take for the Batman character. Kravitz made a convincing cat woman. Wright is god as always. Colin Farrell's take on The Penguin was interesting. Turturro was excellent. I even got used to Dano's riddler / Bane mashup. Unfortunately most of their efforts are wasted. It's literally too dark for one. You can barely see what's going on. While Pattinson's Batman is passable his Bruce Wayne is just terrible. In fact in this film Bruce Wayne is only distinguishable from his Bat Man character by the pointy ears on his mask. If you close your eyes it is impossible to tell which is on screen. I don't know if that was an intentional production choice but it didn't work for me. The film is long and plodding with overwhelming soundtrack and overly dramatic scenes that have little to no relevance. How many times did they do the slow Batman walking steps with everyone watching? One reason that the film is three hours long is that at least a half hour is devoted to Batman slow walking into scenes. Andy Serkis's Alfred is completely wasted as also is Sarsgaard. Most of all the story is just so boring that I didn't even pause the film when I had to go to the bathroom.

My wife fell asleep after about an hour, we ended up leaving an hour and half into it because it was just so so boring. There were only two scenes that had any action at all.

"You can only do so much to a story told so many times, yet the audience gets drawn in and excited for the next generations remake. I wasn't too keen on seeing Batman, I felt it was done right and sealed with Christopher Nolan, but what we have here was a creative attempt at was otherwise just another Batman movie.The whole drawing in of Batman was how edgy it is supposed to be. To the average viewer, this movie can easily be an outcast from other traditional hero movies. Saying that, the expectation is there that you still have to make it appeal to a wide audience and certain boundaries can't be crossed. When will they ever be crossed? Maybe never. To my viewing, this was still an incredibly safe play coated with dark layouts and haunting voice overs. The day I would ever see a true 18A Batman movie or something so off-putting will be the day that I'm convinced that Gotham is a complete hell-hole. Wishful thinking.The acting was strong, with the material they had to work with, each character absolutely did what they could. The script and writing seemed a bit raw. This movie focused on a lot of visuals to fill in the long run time of 3 hours and, heck, this did feel very long at times. This was do to the boring slow tone and uneventful writing for most of the movies meat and potatoes.Robert Pattison takes the task of being our Batman for the next how many years. I have mix feelings. Firstly, I didn't like his costume, his mask seemed like it was bought at a store a day before shooting and nothing particular stood out about it. Pattison's Bruce Wayne could use some work. To some, he's emo and edgy and he's ""cool"". He's like our counterculture hero of the fictional world - one that often doesn't get portrayed too often. To others, including myself, he looked like some Machinegun Kelly rip-off look a like or the dude at the start of the Black Parade music video. Ultimately, it's an attempt to portray a different version of Bruce, one that I can at least applaud to, but with some work to be done.With how experimental and unpolished The Batman felt, it does just barely enough to not completely disown.

"The Batman was alright overall but it had its bits and pieces that were disadvantaging. First off, I believe Robert Pattinson was a good selection to play Batman. Though I did not expect him to play such a depressed suicidal looking Bruce Wayne which he had a different vibe than the previous Bruce Wayne actors like Christian Bale and Ben Affleck. Ok Pattinson, your Twilight saga's been over for 10 years and no need to put your vampire acting into this Batman series. Just the whole movie was a bit too dark for an average Batman.

"This movie was atrocious. First of all, Wilson, the volleyball in Castaway had more emotional range than Robert Pattinson did throughout this film. Whether his mask was on or off, he just had the same blank expression. I was actually rooting for The Riddler, who was actually exposing deep corruption and bringing parties to justice. Batman on the other hand merely stops one minor assault at the beginning, then is basically there just to solve riddles which don't even matter since The Riddler's plans all unfolded anyway. He's less of a super hero and more like a police detective that plays dress up. Even Catwoman had a better plot line than he did. The film culminates with Catwoman having to save his lame ass from falling off the catwalk, where he then proceeds to jump on a wire, cut it, and fall below anyway. I guess he already used all his grappling wires to needlessly shoot a few goons. As a flood comes rushing in at the end of the film we see everyone, who knew a flood was coming, all standing on the ground floor of the stadium like idiots. Literally nothing about this movie was sensible or entertaining. This pile of trash makes even the Burton and Schumacher movies look good. I'll take Arnold Schwarzenegger's cheesy ""ice to see you"" lines over anything that occurs in this 3 hour disaster. The fact that this movie has decent reviews and won any awards absolutely blows my mind.

"Wow! What an boring piece of hash. I remember the Dark Knight Hype and watching the 3 Films to join the hype train. Oh gosh. The Dark Knight series was the most overrated set of movies of all time.When I thought it couldn't get worse. The Batman has arrived... Yet again.Was this movie any better than any of the Dark Knight movies or does it need touch of Taiki Watititi? (The guy who made Thor 4).About: A serial killer is killing VIPs because he's out for revenge because he's an orphan. Batman is putting his convinent detective skills to the test. While Lenny Kravits daughter has enters the story. *yawn*.Story and production:
The story had a chance but it decided to bore me with dry dialogue, horrible accents, with an absurd runtime. 2:50 runtime of boredom.The acting overall was atrocious. The accents were horrid. Many of the gangsters and police spoke like they were auditioning to be a stand in.Then there is The Watcher who spoke like a 1940s detective. I didn't like it. It didn't mesh well.Lenny's daughter was horrible. Oh gosh easily the worse part. Felt like she was a Newb actor. The portrayal was weak.Then there is batman... He was okay. With what was given he was out of his element. I hate batman and even I can agree this batman wasn't that special. All he did was stand there. No lie. Batman stood there for 97% of the movie. Had only 2 action fight scenes. And also sat to speak to Alfred.I hate car chase scenes. Batman is a tech savvy OG. Why go through so much property damage like MoS? All he has to do was blow a tire and problem solved. Nope... A life or 2 probably died just to chase 1 guy that they abandoned Anyways...
Haha! Seriously. Batman caused a commotion for 1 guy. Then abandoned him so he can wuddle like a penguin.For a ""superhero"" film. It was a hash production. This movie was likely made for propaganfear. Someone probably pitched an unrelated movie idea WB thought it was crap then said just add batman to it so they can make a couple dollars.Highlight: The bad acting. And having to bring up Caucasian Privilege when it was not Ness and had nothing to do with anything.Main Intelligence: 4.Cliches: overdone car chase scenes. In nearly every batman film.RacebaitingIs this film worthy? No. 2:50 runtime is overkill. The movie was very boring that it felt like torture.Instead of parents grounding their children they should make them watch this movie for 2:50 hours. That would fix their spoiled behaviour... Maybe...
Back In the day batman films use to be for all. Now these movies are made for adults that have nothing left in the tank. There was no energy, colour or fun in this movie. I'm not saying to make it be like Thor 4. I just wish they made a fun movie like Batman Forever, Returns or batman and Robin. Those were good/fun batman films.Worthless Mutt alert: They shown a dirty filthy dog swimming in the Gotham flood.Should you watch this? No.I thought this movie would have improved the character batman. Nope. They made him even more boring.I hate batman. But still I'm able to give this character so many chances. 70% of batman products are hash. The Batman is of no exception.

"This new iteration of the Batman mythos starts with a Batman just a couple of years into his reign. The time is similar to that of the Nolan trilogy but darker and perhaps more grounded but what I like most about this iteration is that it's a detective story that doesn't rely on action.Robert Pattinson is great as Batman/ Bruce Wayne but my favourite performance was Colin Farrell as The Penguin. Most of the rest of the top notch cast were great too with the exception of Andy Serkis as Alfred whose take was all wrong and Paul Dano was very hit and miss as The Riddler (More miss).Now on to the major issues that stopped this from being my favourite Batman film. Firstly the cinematography is too dark even for Batman films, it's quite eye straining a lot of the time and is nowhere as gorgeous as other dark toned films from the same director. The film is constantly very dark and wet but whereas something like Blade Runner is still crisp with east to see detail, this one just often feels too dark. Secondly the film is way too long for the story they are trying to tell.

"First off, I'm thinking that maybe the Batman story is getting kind of ""overtold.""
Maybe Hollywood should lay off just trying to retell the same superhero stories over and over and over again and come up with some new ideas instead. I know, I know.. they sell. Yup, they suckered me into going yet again. Maybe I shouldn't have gone to what feels like my hundredth Batman movie and expected some fresh entertainment, right? Perhaps I'm just Batmanned out, but I seriously felt that this movie was FAR too long. Long and dreary. Slow. Characters took waaay too long to say something, way too long to do something (even waiting for Batman to walk from one place to another sometimes warranted an eyeroll). There were too many pauses and too many times I was thinking, ""Oh, just get ON with it!""As far as the characters/acting goes... Robert Pattinson was a very good Batman, though the Bruce Wayne side of the character was pretty much ignored (make him a recluse and you don't have to bother developing that side of the character, right?). Jeffrey Wright did a great job as Gordon. Would have never guessed that was Colin Farrell as the Penguin (amazing makeup!), but the character wasn't really developed much, not that there wasn't enough time to do so in this dreadfully long movie. Zoe Kravitz filled out the Catwoman outfit nicely but, other than that, was not feeling that casting. Once the combat mask came off, Paul Dano had all the creepy facial expressions of a demented psycho, but would have liked to have had the reveal and some peeks at the Riddler during the planning and implementation of his ""dastardly deeds"" instead of just seeing him (except for ""in costume"") after the fact.Did the end of the movie leave me feeling like I ""wanted more?""

The story is heavily focused around Catwoman and as a result Batmans story/character, is just secondary.I do like the whole film noir vibe, but as a result Batman is just another detective.Robert Pattinson really had no prescence as a Batman. He was not fierce, he was not intimidating and he was not a force to be scared of. Likewise for Commissioner Gorden.Many people may think I'm being harsh, but Christian Bale was fierce and had prescence, as Batman. The three 3 films, followed the psyche of his character well.This is just really a novelty movie and if they make a second, they really need to improve.As a last note I did like Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman and she made the role her own.

"I was genuinely looking forward to this, unlike many people, I was interested to see what Robert Pattinson did with the role, and where this story would take us.I left the Cinema with very mixed feelings.The overall tone, mood, cinematography and score of this film are excellent, there is much inspiration pulled from previous films such as Se7en, Zodiac, Blade Runner, Taxi Driver etc. Some of the cinematography is also reminiscent of films from the 1970's, very gritty and grainy with soft focus, take the subway station scene near the beginning of the film for instance). The Gotham presented here is a real dystopia, much more so than in previous film outings. It pushes up to the borderline of ""too far"" but never quite crosses it, you can just about understand why people still live there when they don't have much other choice, but only just.Pattinson was a very good Batman (although not so good as Bruce Wayne) quite reserved and not too flashy with the gadgets, this made for a good change of character compared to what we are used to, I also liked the way he works the actual crime scenes with the Police, this gave a very refreshing and different perspective. You also get a very good sense of the fact that the criminals really fear the Batman. The general public are preyed on by the criminals, but the criminals are also afraid to step into the shadows and back alleys of Gotham because they are preyed on by the Batman, which is a nice touch.The Riddler is also a rather good villain in the vain of the Zodiac as previously mentioned, even though his ""master plan"" really loses steam and becomes a little muddled towards the end.There are some issues with this film, and I will touch on them here.For starters, and the main issue for me, it is just far too long. In all honesty, a full hour could be cut from this film and it would actually be better for it.Catwoman could be completely removed and the film would not suffer at all, in fact, again, it would be better without the character and her plot-line. Also the useless ""romance"" plot which has no chemistry and really goes nowhere, only really exists to extend the running time.Lt. Gordon (aka Basil Exposition) is useless, how he ever ascended to his eventual role in Gotham is quite beyond me. He basically serves to provide an oratory narrative for the audience about what is going on. Every time they find a clue he just stands there and says ""what does that mean?"" and Batman gives him the answer.The plot also moves around too much and tries to cover too many characters and too many different arcs (this may be the cause of the running time).To sum up:
Whilst it has succeeded in some areas, it has failed miserably in others, and this spoiled my enjoyment of what could have been an extremely well crafted two hour (two and a half at the very maximum) film rather than three hours with much unnecessary fat.Unfortunately most films are heading this way nowadays: Bond, Fast and Furious etc they are all 2hrs 45mins plus, and they just are not the types of film to warrant such a running time, Batman is in the same group.With The Batman, if they cut a couple of characters, strengthened a couple of other characters, reduced the running time and tightened the script up, it would have been a real winner.

There's a one sided development of the character and that was Batman only and Bruce Wayne was just nowhere in the movie. I can't speak for the acting skills of Robert P. Because it's just plain and one sided like what i've said. The plot would like to excite the audience but in the end, Batman just did what the riddler wants and I could definitely say there's no resolve after the film.

"Matt Reeves usually delivers but soon as the cast was announced I was lost and still am. None of them are great. I mean seriously 8.8 rating lol. It seems the more boring a film gets the more the attention everyone loves it despite it been such a slow film. I'm glad I have the Burton/Keaton films, they was dark and still with a comic book feel. I don't like films that was fun try to be too serious, it ruins the whole idea of a character. I didn't mind the Nolan films but even them easily over blown, Bale was great but no Keaton.

"Honestly the slow pacing didn't bother me that much. But I knew going in so that helped. If you go in wanting it will be similar to a fast paced Avenger movie this is not for you. Definitely the first half is better than the second half. At the mid point the focus moves off the Riddler to Falcone and the sub plot involving the Waynes. By all means there is a very interesting story there but that dragged a bit too long. When the focus shifts back to the Riddler there are a few plot points that you can call into question, including an ending that should have been shortened. Overall though if you like meticulous detective stories...enjoy!",honestly slow pacing bother much knew going helped go wanting similar fast paced avenger movie definitely first half better second half mid point focus move riddler falcone sub plot involving wayne mean interesting story dragged bit long focus shift back riddler plot point call question including ending shortened overall though like meticulous detective story enjoy,positive,685
"Everything except for the set design and cinematography was a let down for me in this film. The script was often laughable, the characters had no perceivable arch or revelations, the plot was delivered and constantly hinged on dialogue and supposition - first rule of film school: show don't tell! It felt like the original script had been for a five hour film that had to be cut down, with over explained plot points to allow for a wider, younger audience to follow it.I was so ready to love all the characters played by such an excellent cast, however Catwoman felt weak with nothing original in her character (are we still putting female superheros in heels?) And Batman just never felt like he had his moment. We also never had any costume or gadget/car/bike reveal moments to indulge in, we never saw him suit up or transform. We were never really introduced to Bruce Wayne and his public image. It felt like we were given moments where we were supposed to think ""wow he's so complicated,"" but there was nothing to really support these moments other than him delivering a few too many punches to someone's face - though the violence of this was skirted over so it very literally lacked any punch. There was one scene that tried to create a sense of his vulnerability but it came so late in the film and was essentially another spoon fed plot explaination - ""No, it wasn't him, it was HIM!"" - that any sort of character depth was again, lost.Another issue was the overbearing and continuous score. Plenty of films use an undertone of music to continually create and build tension but this was just over the top and turned up to 10 the whole time. In a 3 hour long film the magic wears off pretty quick and you end up picking faults rather than getting lost in the story. It meant that by the 100th plot reveal conversation with screaming music on it I didn't really care anymore. Especially the final confrontation when Batman and villian meet. So over it.Without wanting to spoil too much, it also felt tiresome to have another superhero movie that relied heavily on some form of social media platform to tell us a story. Watching Paul Dano in a gimpish mask that covers his entire face (he's literally one of the best actors around and we barely get to enjoy it) delivering threats through a fake twitter stream is just not exciting and/or scary.What we DID enjoy was the art direction, the sets felt incredibly rich and full of detail, we wanted to see more, more of Bruce Waynes home, more workshop! The lighting was also superb, it felt darkly cinematic and the rain made it feel very chlostrophobic - there were moments that felt original and innovative. However they were often ruined a little by the violent scenes which felt over choreographed or just skimmed over (another reason why it felt the film had been lowered for a younger audience) and because the music was always so intense you were kind of expecting to see something gruesome or horrifying but it never came.I hope we see another film with the same cast in lead roles, as despite all that is mentioned above, RP definitely suits this role and with a better story the whole look and character design would be awesome. Also more Catwoman but make her cooler plz.Overall, a visually rich, well made film with all the components for success, making its simplified delivery and lack of depth all the more disappointing.",everything except set design cinematography let film script often laughable character perceivable arch revelation plot delivered constantly hinged dialogue supposition first rule film school show tell felt like original script five hour film cut explained plot point allow wider younger audience follow ready love character played excellent cast however catwoman felt weak nothing original character still putting female superheros heel batman never felt like moment also never costume gadget car bike reveal moment indulge never saw suit transform never really introduced bruce wayne public image felt like given moment supposed think wow complicated nothing really support moment delivering many punch someone face though violence skirted literally lacked punch one scene tried create sense vulnerability came late film essentially another spoon fed plot explaination sort character depth lost another issue overbearing continuous score plenty film use undertone music continually create build tension top turned whole time hour long film magic wear pretty quick end picking fault rather getting lost story meant th plot reveal conversation screaming music really care anymore especially final confrontation batman villian meet without wanting spoil much also felt tiresome another superhero movie relied heavily form social medium platform tell u story watching paul dano gimpish mask cover entire face literally one best actor around barely get enjoy delivering threat fake twitter stream exciting scary enjoy art direction set felt incredibly rich full detail wanted see bruce wayne home workshop lighting also superb felt darkly cinematic rain made feel chlostrophobic moment felt original innovative however often ruined little violent scene felt choreographed skimmed another reason felt film lowered younger audience music always intense kind expecting see something gruesome horrifying never came hope see another film cast lead role despite mentioned rp definitely suit role better story whole look character design would awesome also catwoman make cooler plz overall visually rich well made film component success making simplified delivery lack depth disappointing,positive,686

"This latest incarnation of the Batman cinema seems to have invested most of its creativity in the technology of making stuff look more believable. Instead of relying on green screen compositing the director uses enormous LED display screens to create scene backgrounds. The difference is noticeable, as the characters are often literally being lit by the actual scene. So The Batman is worth a glimpse if only for such a technical innovation.Beyond that this is a very amateurish production. The characters are unmemorable, like a cast from a college production.

"This is a looooong film.. 3 hrs.... I admit I only made it an hour and a half. I was so, so, bored by it. When I checked to see how much time was left in this, noticed it wasn't even really half way through.. I was frankly surprised.. half the film and the plot still seemed to be in the basic, ""early"", discovery stages.This is why people don't go to theaters any longer. Imagine paying $50 (just for yourself) and halfway through you start to feel bored.. then the cheap seats at the theater start hurting your backside... and you still have an hour an a half to sit there.... That is why theaters are dying. Films are no longer priced or made for theater going.This film REALLY needs to be seen in multiple sittings if it's watched at all.. watch half.. take a break for a day.. then watch the other half. One sitting is just atrocious.The entire tone of this film may be best described as ""morose"" or ""melancholy"". It's like watching depression on a screen - no excitement, no intrigue, just pure apathy and nihilism. Everyone, except Kravitz, speaks in low grumbling whispers. I mean essentially EVERYONE. Like ALL the male actors are trying to do an impression of Christian Bale's Batman. The entire film sounds like it's being listened to with a pillow over your head. Audio is best described as ""monotone"" and without variation.After an hour and a half of listening to muddled whispers combined with the incessant low-octave organ tones... I was just sick of it. Even the ""action"" sequences are rather unexciting and boring (what there was of them in an hour and a half -- 2 I think) .. dimly lit, difficult to see with the same basic morose organ tones, having merely a slightly faster pacing for action. But really just felt like ""more of the same"". I was starting to personally feel morose and melancholy the longer this continued.What HORRIBLE direction this film suffers from.... There REALLY needed to be brighter, sunnier days and more robust, upbeat, audio at times to make the nights seem far more ominous and mysterious. Every aspect of this film needed ""contrast"" if not directly then in concept - visuals, audio, sets. But EVERYTHING is simply monotone dark and woeful. Color seems desaturated across the entire film, making it ALL look either dark and dimly lit at night or muted and grey during other scenes. ""Style"" and direction even obfuscates the actual plot points. Every aspect looks and sounds the same.No one took a step back and realized it was simply a depressing film to look at - then throw in the incessant organ tones as if someone is sitting next to you humming the same two notes, in the same key, for 3 hours.... it's even more depressing.... ugh.I kept hearing Ledger's Joker in my head... ""Why so serious?""I understand trying to avoid the ""cartoon-like"" 90s films.. but this swung the pendulum waaaaaay too far in the other direction.

"Batman, as he was originally conceived nearly 80 years ago, was a violent vigilante detective, who killed villains without mercy. Shortly after his debut in 1939-40, Batman was toned down from a killer to a crime fighter with a moral code, refusing to become totally lawless like his enemies. 'The Batman' 2022, portrays the darker and more dangerous superhero with a tenuous moral code. Robert Pattinson plays a disturbed and quietly raging Batman that could kill if pushed too far in the worst of circumstances. More than once, this Batman is tested and comes very close to losing control.The Batman is locked in a battle of wits with the Riddler, Paul Dano who was poorly cast for this role and is unconvincing, more annoying than scary. Important people are being viciously murdered. In a constant race to save the next victim, Batman opposes and then joins forces with a skilled Cat Burglar, Selina Kyle played by ZoÃ« Kravitz. Batman keeps showing up at Police investigations, escorted by the soon to become commissioner, Police Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright). The Riddler leaves riddles addressed to Batman, and with a bit of help from Alfred (Andy Circus) and Gordon, and Selina, Batman solves each terrible clue, leading him to the Riddler's next victim. Batman has some very nice and believable tech at his disposal, a realistic Bat Cave and one of the best Batmobile's I have seen. The 1969 Dodge Charger is awesome.This is a long movie, an epic at just under 3 hours. I was surprised how the seemingly slow plot and brooding dark atmosphere never got boring. I found that The Batman quietly and effortlessly told a great story. The only exception was the conclusion which was a little rushed compared to the hours it took to get there. This is a quiet, dark, and gritty Batman that somehow falls just a little short of expectation. I enjoyed the streamlining of the characters, removing all the camp and theatrics usually associated with the Batman character. The Batman is well primed for a sequel too. Overall, a great movie that I will watch again.",batman originally conceived nearly year ago violent vigilante detective killed villain without mercy shortly debut batman toned killer crime fighter moral code refusing become totally lawless like enemy batman portrays darker dangerous superhero tenuous moral code robert pattinson play disturbed quietly raging batman could kill pushed far worst circumstance batman tested come close losing control batman locked battle wit riddler paul dano poorly cast role unconvincing annoying scary important people viciously murdered constant race save next victim batman opposes join force skilled cat burglar selina kyle played zo kravitz batman keep showing police investigation escorted soon become commissioner police lt james gordon jeffrey wright riddler leaf riddle addressed batman bit help alfred andy circus gordon selina batman solves terrible clue leading riddler next victim batman nice believable tech disposal realistic bat cave one best batmobile seen dodge charger awesome long movie epic hour surprised seemingly slow plot brooding dark atmosphere never got boring found batman quietly effortlessly told great story exception conclusion little rushed compared hour took get quiet dark gritty batman somehow fall little short expectation enjoyed streamlining character removing camp theatrics usually associated batman character batman well primed sequel overall great movie watch,negative,719

"Batman is one of the most recogniceable faces in comics. With a lot of movies under its utility belt, from corny, to serious to whatever was Batman and Robin, it is time for Pattinson to get a place. Unfortunately for him... it is not last because Clooney was the bat once.I'll start with the general rant, before going into details.First of all... the pacing is horrible. The movie suffers a lot because of it. The movie should have lasted hour and a half, maybe a little more. It constantly tries to show an intimidating batman that moves in calculated, heavy steps and it fails miserably, as Pattinson is probably one of the least intimidating batmen, again, because Clooney and, unfortunately, Adam West are less intimidating. And in the case of West, that was the intention!You will spend very long periods of time looking at slow moving batman, broody batman and stiff batman, barely talking in a low voice (also during horribly pretentious voiceovers!) that is not the most ridiculous because Bale was the batman once... which drags the movie seriously, to the point that it starts feeling like a batman movie at the 2 hours mark, a cardinal sin in a 3 hours movie. Things get so much drag you could put the movie at 1.5 speed and it would barely make a watchable movie.The casting was interesting. Again, bless Pattinson's soul he is a good actor... but I can't see him as any kind of Batman, and unfortunately he showed why. Zoe was not the worse catwoman but that is because Halle was the Catwoman once. Farrell was, as usual, the best, devouring each scene he appeared. He is really trying and giving everything. Turturro was a fun addition and was also entertaining by his own right. Everyone else was just meh.The music its all over the place. Sometimes it is pretentious, sometimes its just generic, sometimes it is just not there, sometimes i is even inadequate.Now, the focus of the movie was to give a detective batman, so I will forgive the very weak action scenes that lasted 5 minutes total. It simply failed at detective. Most of the puzzles had to be solved by someone else, which is very weak for THE WORLD'S GREATEST DETECTIVE. In fact, he sucks so much at it the Riddler had to spell it for him constantly and, believe it or not, the Riddler won and completed his plan! Of course, the movie just decides to... ignore it and decides that the Riddler lost. The ending is unsatisfying at best, insulting at worse.The thing was that I actually think the plot, the story, and the mystery had a lot of potential. Unfortunately they get dragged by the awful pacing to the point that you end just waiting for something to happen. That's not very fun or entertaining.

"Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) is The Batman. His parents' murders remain unsolved. Gotham is drowning in crime and corruption.

In fact, she's the reason for the movie's one big flaw. It's too long. Three hours is a long time to spend with a depressed angry Batman. Catwoman's emotional arc is much more compelling and ends at the two hour mark. The movie should wrap up at that point. She is such a compelling character and her story is so much more emotional. The story should wrap around her journey. Riddler's reveal can be left to the next movie. He's a more compelling villain when left unseen. His riddles are the true stars of his character.

"BOOM! POW! BATMAN! Batman emerges from the shadows, ""The hell are you supposed to be?"", Said the cocky masked man, supported by his gang of followers. Batman moves in and takes out the men one by one with ease, ""Vengeance..."". Batman drives home to have some down time, he hears ""On this day Thomas Wayne..."" Batman listens in for news about the riddler. A sadistic killer is on the loose in Gotham and Batman must stop them. Batman follows along a trail of clues left by the riddler. Can he save Gotham in time? MUHAHAHAHA. I agree with the majority rating on this movie 3.9, I mean, it was Batman we all expected everything we saw more or less. Batman has been reused probably- millions of times, Batman is a mortal who uses combat and gadgets obtained by his wealth to fight crime, they needed to add something new to make this movie interesting, and it just didn't have anything new to put it simply.I mean, it was Batman we all expected everything we saw more or less. Batman has been reused probably- millions of times. With a Budget of 200 Millions dollars. I think badass Bruce Wayne himself would have spent the budget better than, Wb, Dc Films, etc. It was missing something big for that load of cash. Did they put the extra 100Million into ""The"" in the title, what a joke. The action lacked in terms of intensity and realism, but was brutal nonetheless and was enjoyable. Brightened main scenes in the movie with a big combat scene. However, the movie was filled with reused, just about everything. From the plot of the Riddler, like we haven't seen that before. If you're going to reuse Batman at least give us a new Villain. The Riddler was introduced in 1948, we are watching Batman fight the same dude with the same exact gadgets from 1948.Overall, if you enjoy Batman films, like Batman, have a goal to watch every Batman film, then obviously watch this movie. No matter how poor the movie turned out ultimately, it will always reach a big audience for the use of the Batman name. Taking out the idea of Batman altogether, the movie was very poor and boring and I was very uninterested the majority of the time watching the film. However, solely based on this film being a Batman film, a huge name. I suggest watching it anyway to form your own opinions, and just watch it because it's Batman.

"Not really what I was expecting. The trailer along with the directors comments about the project made it seem like they were aiming for a ""detective"" style Batman. Reminiscent of the Batman found in graphic novels like The Long Halloween and Hush. I was really excited about that, especially when the movie Seven had been mentioned several times as an inspiration for the film. In a sense I guess we got that element in Batman 2022? But we also got a bunch of other, less interesting stuff.The movie is simply too long. It's packed with subplots that make the film kind of confusing. All the different subplots and elements also disrupt the pacing of the film and made me feel like I was watching three different movies at once.There's the ""Seven"" type thriller about Batman, Gordon, Catwoman and the Riddler. Here we get some really great scenes with amazingly choreographed violence. The Riddlers first murder is messy and terrifying. Not your typical Hollywood murder that looks all smooth and cool. These scenes are few however and mostly found in the first 40 min of the film. After that it's like the studio took a look and was like NOPE, NOT NOLAN ENOUGH.Because after that, it gets this Nolan-esque theme of chaos and terror, with a watered down version of Heath ledger's joker. Paul Dino is a really good actor but he really overdoes it with Riddler in this one. He comes off more silly than intimidating. I thought he was going to be all silent, scary and a literal psycho. Instead he's a whiny incel.The terror attacks at the end really made it feel like The Dark Knight Rises. There are really similar themes to the attacks in TDKR and the Riddlers motives are basically the same as Banes.Then there's the subplot about Bruce and his relationship to his parents. It's just not interesting enough. So what if his father wasn't a perfect guy. It just seems so stupid that the freaking master detective Batman never even googled his parents and found out about their very public ""secrets"". He's supposed to be the worlds greatest detective!Not a terrible film. It had its moments. Not the detective story I was hoping for though.

"There is only one thing on this movie I liked: Gotham and the lighting. Everything else was written by a 12 year old without any real life experience. That is explaining the good rating because when a 12 year old watches the movie he thinks ""Yeah... this was fun!"" ... but for a grown-up who clearly can see behind the curtain THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE! There is not one character in this film which is consistent and acts like a ""normal"" person. And the world's GREATEST DETECTIVE is just bored throughout the film and not showing ONCE why he is the great detective.

"The idea with this movie was to reinvent the Batman universe. And for sure, this is a whole new kind of story to Batman.Is it better? Worse?Cant really tell or judge.Mostly has this to do with the poor choice of main actor to portrait Batman.If I am to be less harsh, Pattison is just booring and less espressive than Nic Cage.

"Granted when this movie was first announced and it was Robert Pattinson that was set to portray Batman/Bruce Wayne, I have to say that I wasn't exactly thrilled. But having seen Pattinson in the 2019 movie ""The Lighthouse"", I will admit that things were definitely brightening up for this 2022 Batman project.However, given me not being overly keen on superhero movies as per se, then ""The Batman"" was not a movie that I rushed out to watch in the cinema. A home viewing of the movie would suffice.And now having seen what writers Matt Reeves and Peter Craig brought to the screen, I will say that this 2022 movie from director Matt Reeves was actually rather enjoyable. And yeah, Robert Pattinson definitely put on a great performance and carried the mantle of the Caped Crusader more than sufficiently. He was actually rather good in the role, and it is great to see how the sparkling days of ""Twilight"" are just a thing in the past.The storyline in ""The Batman"" was good and entertaining, with contents of crime, drama and good old fashioned action. So ""The Batman"" has something for just about everyone in the audience, and it definitely felt like a movie that was at its rightful place in the DC universe. I was certainly entertained by this 2022 movie.The movie also has a great cast ensemble. Robert Pattinson definitely was nice in the movie, which pretty much ended me perceiving him as a sparkly teen heartthrob. Zoë Kravitz was quite good in the role of Selina Kyle/Catwoman. And with the likes of Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, Paul Dano, John Turturro, Andy Serkis and Peter Sarsgaard on the cast list, then you are in for quite a treat. I was really surprised to find out that it was Colin Farrell whom portrayed Oz/The Penguin, because he was fully and wholly unrecognizable. Something I just doesn't understand is why they opted to put Jeffrey Wright in the role as Lt. James Gordon.¨Visually then ""The Batman"" was good, and it definitely spruced up the movie experience quite a lot. While the Batmobile was interesting, it was a strange design for it, as it deviated very much from previous renderings of the vehicle.

I don't know why everyone is raving over this movie. Even if they were trying to do something different with this Batman film it falls short in so many ways and is yet another example of why films in the last 5 years have really missed the mark. Pattinson fails to be a dynamic witty Batman and instead is a somber moody character who fails to create any sort of emotion or like ability with the viewer. Commissioner Gordon also fails to make an impression with very limited and poor dialogue throughout. The mafia/mob aspect of this movie is also very poorly done with it almost coming across as a godfather spoof movie with the overt stereotypical mafia accents and shotty acting. Honesty there was not one memorable or dynamic scene in this movie and simply isn't even in the ball park of the greatness of the dark night or micheal Keatons batman. I know they were trying a different approach with this movie but they failed at every turn.

"Have you ever tried to swallow a spoonful of ash? Have you had to listen to Britney Spears screeching ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" on a continuous 24 hour loop while tied to a chair? Well if you did none of those things imagine how awful it would be! That is what trying to get through watching ""The Batman"" felt like. An eternity.A movie that tries soo hard to be edgy and emo...it drips and then drowns in its own pretentious arrogance. It pretends to be a detective story, dangerously close to plagiarizing David Fincher's masterful masterpiece ""Seven"". But it never amounts to a fraction of that much, much better movie.""The Batman"" is a bloviated and overly stretched cinematic canvas, crumbling under it's own mediocrity. At the hands of Bad Reboot alumni Matt Reeves, it is imbibed with the same creative dead zone which underscores any and all projects with that imprint, or works of people who have been associated in anyway with it.Michael Giacchino's score, one of the few highlights, is completely wasted here on an inferior product. So is the unrecognizable Collin Ferrell and his performance as the Penguin and Andy Serkis as Alfred. Zoë Kravitz barely registers as Catwoman. Jeffrey Wright as race-swapped commissioner Gordon is alright at most. Incel-inspired (wrongly so) Riddler (Paul Dano) is over the top angsty and pathetic and that is not a compliment.Of course then there's the piece de resistance, Robert Pattinson.

Her catwoman is the worst that I've seen in a long time.Third, the movie is at least 60 minutes too long. Very few movies can pull of anything more than 120 minutes, and this isn't one of them. I couldn't wait for it to finally end.Fourth, it's boring. Despite there being some good scenes, for the most part it's boring. Look, it's a freaking superhero movie.

"This is probably the most intelligent Batman script on screen. Everyone who matters is complex. It endeavours to convey something about the character that doesn't reek of edgelord or boring moral relativism. World building is very smart and rolled out with impactful moments. No one is likeable, everyone is understandable. There's a couple contrivances that I think most would roll with easily, given it's a super hero flick. Solid performances, nothing incredible-but certainly solid. It takes itself seriously - thankfully - something super hero films often falter with, undermining the story.In Blade Runner 2049 they codify the aesthetic as ""urban snow trash"", if I remember correctly. Substitute that was with rain, and you've got something comparable; in so far as colour palette/story principles. The emotional soundscape made me think of early Conner Oberst. Little bit emo. Little bit angry and sad. Adolescent but valid. The hunt for an unpredictable killer, tied to nihilistic, systemic components is also heavily present.Overall, this was a pleasant surprise. The cinematography is uneven, with high highs and uninteresting lows. The pacing is slightly off, and feels a bit overlong. And the Penguin feels like the only uninteresting character, the predominate drag, maybe. Otherwise, though, solid stuff.

"It kept my attention, pace wasn't bad for the length of the movie, but it could've been so much better. I loved that you get to see the detective side of Batman, but it lacked a certain authenticity, dare I say more intensity in the role. Very sloppy Bruce Wayne, and that I couldn't get behind; as well as how he related to Alfred.Unsure if Pattinson is right for the role, but we'll have to wait and see if there will be a sequel.

"For those of you fossils who are old enough to remember the Batman with Keaton and then those of you who watched bales Batman, this movie will be different for you. I grew up with both. Don't forget Val Kilmer lol. No way George Clooney. Is this bad? No. Just different. I like the dark tone and visuals. Environment feels like Gotham. That's something Nolan didn't do well. Now the first 2 Batman's had a dark tone, but the environment was not right. Too staged. Maybe right for the 80s early 90s. But not now. Too comic-bookie. If that makes sense. This movie feels real. Similar to Nolan's.Now, acting wise, I don't have any complaints. Acting as good as the other Batmans. Twilight did a good job being an emo Bruce. I didn't feel like we got a lot of actual in depth character with him though. Nolan and bale did better. This Jim Gordon was the best imo. The Alfred from Nolan's was better.Now, the villains. This riddler was different than I was used too, but not bad. Def ain't no Jim Carey. They used social media and riddles and evil along with his IQ to do stuff. Good idea. Still haven't seen a villain outdo ledgers joker though. Hell even Nicholsons joker is legendary. I prefer the Carey riddler. Closer to the Arkham games too.Catwoman was ok. I think Batman 2 catwoman was better. A darker/sinister version. This one though is more towards comics and realistic. I still love Danny devitos penguin. But this one closer to Arkham games too.Overall the movie is good. Not great. The 8 rating is valid. I see it as a Batman year one, just different villains. Nolan's Batman had the real world tech. Keaton had the comic book stuff. Kilmer and good god Clooney had the silly but new comic book tech. Twilight had the real world just starting out tech.

"The tricky thing about reviving a long-lived franchise is, it's always going to be compared to its predecessors. And, as the caped crusader goes, that history is awfully long and speckled. Tim Burton dealt with this when he helmed the 1989 iteration, dodging complaints that it was so fundamentally different from the Adam West camp of twenty years prior. Christopher Nolan fought an uphill battle in overcoming the damage inflicted by Joel Schumacher's missteps. Now, in the wake of Ben Affleck's turn beneath the cowl, Matt Reeves faces a different, but similar fight in justifying his vision of a spandex-clad detective in the crumbling urban decay.Reeves gives us a younger Batman, less seasoned and polished than the Kilmer/Clooney/Affleck years, but also not a rookie. This isn't an origin story; this bat's reputation has already been established in Gotham and he's fostered a tenuous working relationship with certain members of the police force. He's visible enough to draw the attention of a violent, counter-culture master criminal who addresses hints and clues like love letters and sprinkles them around his prolific crime scenes. But he lacks that grand, accomplished sense of supreme confidence: a patrolman who's still learning his beat, he makes mistakes and takes lessons from them. Actually, he makes a *lot* of mistakes. This Batman is neither impervious in a fight nor unmatched in an intellectual sense. He often seems like he's out of his depth, reacting and improvising to events beyond his control. That can be humanizing, but it also limits his aura. In terms of raw energy and dramatic appearances, this rendition ranks near the bottom. I might even call him dull.That's a problem with the whole film, in fact. It has inspired and effective moments, isn't demonstrably bad, but constantly feels clinical and lethargic. There's very little dramatic spectacle, so I was never wowed. For all the boastful talk about emphasizing the detective aspect of his character, Batman himself doesn't actually solve much. Alfred cracks most of the riddles, and when he's eventually indisposed, the Riddler complains that his counterpart isn't getting to the answers fast enough. Robert Pattinson's take on the leading role is... okay. He looks the part while in costume, but often overacts, and his take on the brooding Bruce Wayne, as I'd feared, falls on the wrong side of the emo spectrum. Paul Dano's Se7en-influenced Riddler is a fresh reimagining, but the conclusion of his story (or lack thereof) leaves an empty feeling. Hints and implications are dropped all over the place - about Gordon, the Penguin, Catwoman and other noteworthy rogues who shall remain nameless - but none go beyond the level of superficial winks. Batman and Robin's Mister Freeze, for all his cheesy one-liners and bad costume effects, had a more cohesive, satisfying story than any of these characters.I don't want to give the wrong impression. This isn't a bad effort. I admire its influences, and its chutzpah for wearing them loudly on its chest. Gotham is dark and gritty, its corrupt politicians serving as an appropriate mirror to their real-life counterparts. The costumes and set designs look great. But, in a strange way, I feel that it tries too hard to match the execution of 2019's Joker without really grasping what made that movie tick or why the two should be distinctive. Both are deathly serious, heavily visual, mood-reliant character pieces, but where Joker limits its iris to a small, tight group of characters, The Batman is overwhelmed by its cast. Joaquin Phoenix takes us on a private journey in the former film, and it's meaningful when his arc is resolved.

"Wasn't a big fan of it, and ultimately found this movie a bit boring. I appreciated how they had this movie focus on Batman's detective side, but most of the time, it felt like he wasn't getting anywhere, with half of the work and hints being given to him by the people around him. Maybe that was the point, to make him more human as opposed to super duper at everything, but it just felt off having him along for the ride going in circles.Like, when I first saw him standing and staring, I thought, oh he's thinking, he's about to come up with something, until halfway into the movie I realized, oh, he has no idea what's going on.Also, the entire time I felt like I was waiting for a big reveal that never happened. One of the big reveal, I thought was supposed to be apparent from the beginning.It was a young, inexperienced, angsty, and immature Batman, so it made sense for him to be bumbling around a bit, but maybe a bit too much here as he really didn't accomplish much until the end.Strong first half, but droned on for a total of 3 hours.",big fan ultimately found movie bit boring appreciated movie focus batman detective side time felt like getting anywhere half work hint given people around maybe point make human opposed super duper everything felt along ride going circle like first saw standing staring thought oh thinking come something halfway movie realized oh idea going also entire time felt like waiting big reveal never happened one big reveal thought supposed apparent beginning young inexperienced angsty immature batman made sense bumbling around bit maybe bit much really accomplish much end strong first half droned total hour,positive,757

"It's clear to see why there are so many different reboots of the Batman character. Each director puts their own individual spin on the caped crusader and the vision that Matt Reeves presents to us in The Batman is magnificent.Tonally this film was spectacular. It was brooding, dark, violent, gothic, exactly what I wanted. I've seen some reviewers who didn't appreciate this tone which I can understand, it is all down to personal taste after all, but if you enjoy your superheroes throwing more punches than witty quips then this is the film for you.In terms of the performances I can't fault a single one. Robert Pattinson is a fantastic Batman. He fully became the character and looked so domineering in the suit. Zoe Kravitz was the perfect Catwoman. Her back and forth with Pattinson was a real highlight of the film. Colin Farrell as The Penguin was perhaps my favourite performance however. He was insanely good in this film, a truly transformative role and a brilliant interpretation of the character. Jeffrey Wright as well was superb. The entire cast were stellar. No exceptions.Another important aspect of a Batman film is Gotham City itself, and I loved how they brought it together. It had a gothic feel which complimented the plot and themes perfectly. The constant rain and predominantly night time setting made it visually enticing.As for the story, I loved it. We get to see Batman doing some great detective work, working closely with Jim Gordon and piecing together The Riddler's scheme. There are so many references and world building that Batman fans will love, signalling promising things for any sequels and spin offs that get the green light. The action was so well done. The Batman that we see is very rough, violent, still finding his feet, and it makes for some terrific punch ups.For a three hour film it flew by.

It just doesn't feel like decent enough quaility visual that deserve to call it a movie. Youtube parody videos of movies have better movie quality than this garbage. Just watch ""We Remade The Matrix For $20 (""Dodge This"" Scene)"" on Youtube LOL.Nothing new or well done work on this movie at all. Too long and too slow. The mental illness of Batman is too unrealistic, otherwise 90% of the population would roam around like some ""insert animal name""-man/women lmao.The lore in the movie just doesn't make sense.

Not even Afghanistan LOL.Just watching Batman in every scene is cringy AF.

He is obviously crazy and well armed so who can even hope to survive his attacks? But people mistake him as fly LOL.That's not all! The bomb scene was too idiotic.

I guess he is so rich he grew up with ultimate vitamines bruh LOL.Batman's butler is retard. He knows how dangerous Batman is so he has enemies yet he just opens a package came for Bruce Wayne which package states it's for his eyes only. He doesn't even question ""perhaps Bruce bought himself panties of some internet porn star which he wouldn't want anyone to find out"" and he opens the package LOL.The whole romantic aspect of the movie was just too forced.

"I thought about making a very thoughtful review of this movie, but ultimately decided that it would be much better to just make fun of it. When you make an ultra serious and joyless movie about a vigilante in a bat costume you invite people like me to mock it.Lets chase a guy down the highway in the wrong direction going over 100 mph. The guy is literally driving a normal car and is fine ramming into trucks. After chasing him for miles on end, you end up letting him go because it turns out that you are an idiot who knowingly ignored the rules of basic Spanish. The world's greatest detective figures out it is a website lol. He seriously never thought of Googling it or doing any kind of research whatsoever. Lol.....It is so annoying to watch characters who are intelligent for most of the movie become total idiots for plot convenience. The Riddler personally sees to it that all of his targets die except for Bruce Wayne. Why? No explanation other than plot armor. Alfred seems like a smart guy for most of the movie, but then inexplicably decides to open up mail sent from the Riddler as if the very presence of it isn't an immediate danger. If I saw the same kind of letter to the Batman that was found at every MURDER scene, I would be running to the bat cave as fast as I could. Alfred instead decides to sit there and open the mail. Why didn't Selena just shoot Carmine? He was standing right there next to a bodyguard with his back turned. Just kill him. I'll tell you why....the plot required it. Carmine wouldn't have died to the Riddler if she had killed him already. Why did the Riddler go have a cup of coffee and turn himself in after shooting Carmine? How did he even get down there when the police surrounded the building? The plot required it. What about Riddler's final plan? He managed to set up explosives in seven locations without anyone noticing, but for some reason he needs to rely on Bane's henchmen for the final location. Why? Well if he blew up the final location, Batman couldn't come in and save everyone.",thought making thoughtful review movie ultimately decided would much better make fun make ultra serious joyless movie vigilante bat costume invite people like mock let chase guy highway wrong direction going mph guy literally driving normal car fine ramming truck chasing mile end end letting go turn idiot knowingly ignored rule basic spanish world greatest detective figure website lol seriously never thought googling kind research whatsoever lol annoying watch character intelligent movie become total idiot plot convenience riddler personally see target die except bruce wayne explanation plot armor alfred seems like smart guy movie inexplicably decides open mail sent riddler presence immediate danger saw kind letter batman found every murder scene would running bat cave fast could alfred instead decides sit open mail selena shoot carmine standing right next bodyguard back turned kill tell plot required carmine died riddler killed already riddler go cup coffee turn shooting carmine even get police surrounded building plot required riddler final plan managed set explosive seven location without anyone noticing reason need rely bane henchman final location well blew final location batman come save everyone,positive,765
"The sets and costumes look great and the city feels much bigger than other Batman movies.The story is a confused mess. This is a police drama with characters named ""Batman,"" ""Catwoman,"" ""The Joker, etc."" Unfortunately, they feel disconnected from the main story. The plot would change little if they were removed from the film. Making matters worse is that the superhero/villain characters are one dimensional. Batman broods. Catwoman is angry. The Joker yammers. ...in every scene. The police seem confused about whether they want to kill Batman or if it's just fine for him to interfere in their investigations. This would be fine if something happened that changed their minds, but it doesn't. They just act differently in each scene. Like much of this movie, their actions exist outside of cause-and-effect.The first 3/4 of the film offers little. There is no drama or risk that lead up to the final scene. The movie offers no background, no understanding, and god-forbid any character development. There aren't even action scenes to keep you preoccupied. You can watch the final 30 minutes and make up the rest in your head.It's okay to take the franchise in a new direction. The point of going in a new direction is to go somewhere new, and/or to see something new along the way. This film pulls out of the driveway, meanders around a subdivision, and ends at a local Target.

"When the last image faded on the first teaser for The Batman, I realized that despite him being my favourite of the major superheroes since watching repeats of the Adam West Batman with my parents, I've not read any solo comics featuring him.This led to me reading outstanding works such as Batman:Hush by Jeph Loeb and Gotham by Gaslight by Brian Augustyn, and avoiding any further trailers,so I could witness at the cinema the dark knight rise.View on the film:Drawn out from the darkest corners of Gotham,and backed by an ominous score by Michael Giacchino, co-writer/ (with Peter Craig) director Matt Reeves & cinematographer Greig Fraser (who expand on the long one-shot car crash sequence of their earlier team-up Let Me In (2010-also reviewed)) draw from the psychological horror pages of Arkham Asylum by Grant Morrison and Dave McKean, with the engulfed in shadow,tormented paintings by McKean being a clear inspiration in the jagged tracking shots with limited lighting of Batman fighting through the darkness of Gotham, that the Penguin emerges from.Based on Batman: Year Two by Mike W.

"This movie was another step in the dark and serious direction, which made it bland and drawn out. The costumes were uninspiring, as most of them featured the ski mask as their main accessory. This made it seem as though anybody could fill those roles, and that there's nothing special about each hero or villain. Especially Catwoman, the Riddler, and Penguin. Pattinson stood out, being the only one in real costume, and I thought he played the role of Batman well. I also like the dreary and gritty Gotham backdrop, rife with corruption, in which Batman is trying to root out.The acting was OK all around. I though Dano was typecast as the Riddler, trying to bring his quirky/insane acting to the role, but it wasn't convincing since the character was created as a boring fringe internet terrorist with thick glasses and a ski mask. His riddles were also very hard, and Batman solved most of them with relative ease. The one about Spanish grammar was kind of head scratching. Seeing the Penguin, made me miss the one from Batman Returns, with his flippers and top hat. This one played by an unrecognizable Colin Farrell, was just a boring mob boss with a gold tooth.There were some attempts at humor which fell flat, such as Batman muffing up one of his landings and the Batmobile stalling out. It seemed like they were trying to make Batman more of a ordinary man, which isn't what I'm looking for in a superhero movie. What happened to him being able to fly or glide? The scene where he's hanging on a ledge like he's supposed to be in danger, I though he would have just glided away.In summary, the movie took a step into the darker, more serious tone, which made it boring. It made me miss the flair of 90's Batman movies.",movie another step dark serious direction made bland drawn costume uninspiring featured ski mask main accessory made seem though anybody could fill role nothing special hero villain especially catwoman riddler penguin pattinson stood one real costume thought played role batman well also like dreary gritty gotham backdrop rife corruption batman trying root acting ok around though dano typecast riddler trying bring quirky insane acting role convincing since character created boring fringe internet terrorist thick glass ski mask riddle also hard batman solved relative ease one spanish grammar kind head scratching seeing penguin made miss one batman return flipper top hat one played unrecognizable colin farrell boring mob bos gold tooth attempt humor fell flat batman muffing one landing batmobile stalling seemed like trying make batman ordinary man looking superhero movie happened able fly glide scene hanging ledge like supposed danger though would glided away summary movie took step darker serious tone made boring made miss flair batman movie,negative,772

"The worst thing is Pattinson's acting, then comes the cringe portrait of the relationship between him and the Catwoman, and at the same time say hello to the awful make-up job and the editing which made me wonder if it is a professional movie-making or just some random kid did take the whole thing in their hands.Seriously!

"I expected much...I shouldn't have! Having seen this movie might easily be the most disappointing cinema experience this year. 2022 is still young, I know, but it's hardly imaginable seeing any other movie this year where the gap between expectation and (my subjective) reality will be even bigger. What makes me say that? Well, to me, ""The Batman"" felt just like a painfully generic action film stretched to a 3 hour marathon of bombast and unrelatable overacting without any depth. It even made me think about leaving the cinema hall earlier. Don't get me wrong: I really DID enjoy ""The Dark Knight"", ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and especially ""The Joker"" (I know, this here is not a character study) but in comparison to those ones, at least to me, the new Batman almost feels like an obsessive attempt to make the cash tills ring.",expected much seen movie might easily disappointing cinema experience year still young know hardly imaginable seeing movie year gap expectation subjective reality even bigger make say well batman felt like painfully generic action film stretched hour marathon bombast unrelatable overacting without depth even made think leaving cinema hall earlier get wrong really enjoy dark knight dark knight rise especially joker know character study comparison one least new batman almost feel like obsessive attempt make cash till ring,negative,775
"This movie had a lot going against it from the beginning but I was willing to give it a chance. Case in point, I was not a fan when Ben Afleck was cast as Batman, but the writing for the character and his portrayal changed my mind. I'm here to tell you, my forbearance was wasted on this three-hour misadventure.I won't bore readers with obligatory fan-boy complaints like Pattinson wouldn't bulk up and looks like a skinny emo, hate the costume, hate the bat cave, hate the batmobile, etc. My biggest gripe has to do with the screenplay and the soundtrack, both of which are painfully bush league.The screenplay is a mess. Too much time is spent on Bruce Wayne brooding and not enough on advancing the story. I understand the aim for this movie was to one-up the Nolan films by making this as real-world as possible and turning Batman into a film-noir detective instead of a superhero with superhuman abilities and/or impossibly advanced gadgetry. That would work IF you fill the screenplay with interesting characters and compelling drama. There is NONE of that in this movie so it leaves the audience yearning for the gadgetry and abilities. Watch the animated Gotham By Gaslight for a successful adaptation along these lines.The characters as written are pale and washed-out, two-dimensional versions of the characters we are used to. The fact that NONE of these characters were developed in any way IN A THREE HOUR MOVIE is an indictment of how bad the screenplay is. Gordon is just a cop, and not very good at what he does, Selena Kyle is just a thief, and not very good at what SHE does, and Bruce Wayne spends too much time sulking about in a hoodie with his eye sockets still blacked out from the batmask, looking like a goth burnout. Watching this movie, I felt like I was watching an episode of a television series halfway into the first season. This feeling was amplified by the intrusive background music. Which brings me to my final complaint - the soundtrack.A powerful and effective soundtrack can elevate an otherwise mundane movie, or propel a great movie to blockbuster status. The soundtrack for this movie is boring, banal, and frankly just gets in the way. Michael Giacchino was obviously very proud the the four-note motif he composed as ""Batman's theme"" because he bashes the audience over the head with it throughout the movie. Over and over and over again. It's insanely annoying. I know he's an award winning composer with many awards but he phoned this one in folks. This soundtrack actually makes this movie even WORSE. And then there's the mind-numbing Nirvana song ""Something in the Way"" which is also repeated ad nauseum as if to confirm to everyone that this Batman really IS just a nihilistic goth kid having a depressing three hour daydream.I'm so glad I didn't pay to watch this movie.",movie lot going beginning willing give chance case point fan ben afleck cast batman writing character portrayal changed mind tell forbearance wasted three hour misadventure bore reader obligatory fan boy complaint like pattinson bulk look like skinny emo hate costume hate bat cave hate batmobile etc biggest gripe screenplay soundtrack painfully bush league screenplay mess much time spent bruce wayne brooding enough advancing story understand aim movie one nolan film making real world possible turning batman film noir detective instead superhero superhuman ability impossibly advanced gadgetry would work fill screenplay interesting character compelling drama none movie leaf audience yearning gadgetry ability watch animated gotham gaslight successful adaptation along line character written pale washed two dimensional version character used fact none character developed way three hour movie indictment bad screenplay gordon cop good selena kyle thief good bruce wayne spends much time sulking hoodie eye socket still blacked batmask looking like goth burnout watching movie felt like watching episode television series halfway first season feeling amplified intrusive background music brings final complaint soundtrack powerful effective soundtrack elevate otherwise mundane movie propel great movie blockbuster status soundtrack movie boring banal frankly get way michael giacchino obviously proud four note motif composed batman theme bash audience head throughout movie insanely annoying know award winning composer many award phoned one folk soundtrack actually make movie even worse mind numbing nirvana song something way also repeated ad nauseum confirm everyone batman really nihilistic goth kid depressing three hour daydream glad pay watch movie,positive,776

"After many years The Batman has finally made its way to the Cinema and I managed to get to the cinema and watch it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a Batman in the early part of his career having to take on a new foe which will push him to new levels and makes him question his whole motivations.Main Character
There was plenty of controversy when Robert Pattinson was cast as Bruce Wayne/Batman but I actually had high hopes and I have to say I thought he did a really good job. He sold the pretty new Batman well, he is probably the most aggressive version of the character and you just feel the intensity radiating off of him. But there is real development here and I feel like the version we meet at the beginning of the film compared to the one at the end has changed quite a bit and it is well handled. This is very much a Batman film and thus sees him less as Bruce Wayne but when he is, it works well enough it just isn't the focus of the film.Supporting Characters
Zoe Kravitz plays Selina Kyle/Catwoman and she is great. The dynamic between the two of them is really well handled and I really enjoyed watching her character develop as there are some really interesting story parts with her. Paul Dano plays The Riddler and they do an amazing job with this character. He is like a horror character and seeing him go about his mission is fascinating and he was the perfect villain for this film, his motivations were really well executed and this is redemption for this great character. Jeffery Wright plays James Gordon and this is another stellar depiction of the character, he is tough but fair and I really liked the partnership between him and Batman. Despite their relationship being quite new there is clear trust and respect between the two of them. Colin Farrell plays The Penguin and despite being caked in prosthetics it is a really strong character, it feels honest to the comics and creates this really cool mob character that fits well in this universe.Story
The story is expertly handled, this is a true detective story. For the first time really in film, it feels like Batman is a proper detective and this mystery kept me guessing and the twists and turns were really effective. There are so many characters and plot points here that I was worried it was going to be too much, but it all fits together really well and nothing felt out of place to me and that was a really impressive piece of storytelling to me.Script
The script is extremely grim and this is no doubt the darkest Batman film we have ever seen. But it really fit this film and I was fine with it, this film writes all of its characters really well and keeps the film progressing in a really interesting and for me captivating way.Style
The film has an amazing style, Gotham has never looked better, it is so bleak and grey that it feels like it is ripped straight from the comic books. The harder hitting action is so well done and makes Batman way more brutal and less reliant on gadgets which feels extremely fitting for the story that was being told here. Yes, the film is 3 hours but I thought the film was paced really well and I was never bored. There wasn't anything that I thought should have been cut or trimmed down and fair play to Matt Reeves as a director who did an amazing job here.Overall
Overall, The Batman is a truly special comic book film that I loved. Fans of Batman will love it and it is a must watch, I am not saying this film is as good as The Dark Knight but it is pretty close and that is great to see for the character of Batman in 2022.",many year batman finally made way cinema managed get cinema watch review premise film see batman early part career take new foe push new level make question whole motivation main character plenty controversy robert pattinson cast bruce wayne batman actually high hope say thought really good job sold pretty new batman well probably aggressive version character feel intensity radiating real development feel like version meet beginning film compared one end changed quite bit well handled much batman film thus see le bruce wayne work well enough focus film supporting character zoe kravitz play selina kyle catwoman great dynamic two really well handled really enjoyed watching character develop really interesting story part paul dano play riddler amazing job character like horror character seeing go mission fascinating perfect villain film motivation really well executed redemption great character jeffery wright play james gordon another stellar depiction character tough fair really liked partnership batman despite relationship quite new clear trust respect two colin farrell play penguin despite caked prosthetics really strong character feel honest comic creates really cool mob character fit well universe story story expertly handled true detective story first time really film feel like batman proper detective mystery kept guessing twist turn really effective many character plot point worried going much fit together really well nothing felt place really impressive piece storytelling script script extremely grim doubt darkest batman film ever seen really fit film fine film writes character really well keep film progressing really interesting captivating way style film amazing style gotham never looked better bleak grey feel like ripped straight comic book harder hitting action well done make batman way brutal le reliant gadget feel extremely fitting story told yes film hour thought film paced really well never bored anything thought cut trimmed fair play matt reef director amazing job overall overall batman truly special comic book film loved fan batman love must watch saying film good dark knight pretty close great see character batman,positive,778

"I am a huge fan of Matt Reeves' work up to this point when he turend out this massively overlong piece of pseudo-entertainment which I struggled to even finish. Almost all the roles are miscast and even Robert Pattinson doesn't even fit the role. The film becomes unintentionally comedic by having all the characters expressing grim faces all the time and going through a laborious, constructed and nihilistic plot. That is if anything can even be recognized in a film having been shot so dark that it's sometimes unclear what is going on. There is absolutely no suspense in this and I've literally been scratching my head for three straight hours to figure out what it is I'm supposed to take away from this. In my case it's to see a great concept reduced to a superhero-procedural Joker-wannabe that doesn't work at all. Compared to the Nolan-era Batman movies this is a sad result. The score is also dull which robs the movie of any residuel emotional connection. Don't get me wrong, I loved Joker and I believe that Batman deserves a darker take but this whole thing feels like a motivation reel for undecided suicide jumpers.

"This movie was so bad I literally could not finish it. Not because of a lack of love for Batman I am a huge Batman fan but this..... This was awful. I understand what they were trying to do going back to the 70s style noir comic feel and background but it was done.... Well wrong. The atmosphere and set were decent but that's where the fun stopped. The action sequences I did see were flat and comparing to other movies, frankly very boring and busted. The dialogue, especially the self narrating voice overs made me cringe as if listening to nails on a chalk board. The whole movie is too dark to see what the hell is happening 85 percent of the time and even with my surround sound bar at full volume I still had a hard time hearing the dialogue at times. The plot feels rushed ironically for how slow and long this movie is offering in my mind nothing to hold on to to keep interested. The the music choices did not help to bring me into that noir comic realm they wanted me to join. Instead I felt like I was back in high school around kids listening to the most depressing soundtracks ever and not out of enjoyment, simply to keep up the image. It felt like a tossed together metaphor I didn't understand nor did I want to and reminded me of spiderman 3 with toby but honestly it was worse. Lastly, whoever decided Twilight boy Robert Pattinson was the right fit for this role.... I say kudos to you. Originally upon hearing he would be Batman I wondered why they chose him. He's a terrible actor with no range whatsoever. But after seeing what I did of the movie it makes sense now. They knew this movie would be hot garbage and so they employed hot garbage.

"The first 20 or even 30 minutes were great. Loving the realistic looking Gotham, loving the neo-noir setting. It's great. This is gonna be the a gritty greatest detective in action. Loving it. A little along the way you encounter the first awful classic bad writing exposition but you're like... okay, it's fine. Then chief Gordon finds a flash drive and just plugs it right in his own laptop and you're like... okay, that's just plain dumb, but okay. From that point on the movie just goes downhill. Batman turns out to be just a sad emo Bruce Wayne. When he goes to the memorial for the mayor he looks like he's fresh out of rehab heroin addict. Overall you should want to be Batman, not feel sorry for him. Love Andy Serkis as an actor, but he is just the worst Alfred imaginable. They have zero Bruce-Alfred chemistry. Sadly all the other characters felt flat af. Still, watching it I was like, okay it's not amazing, but it's okay, just a solid 5, maybe the end could get it to 6 if it's good. That did not happen tho. The part where Gotham is built in such a way, that 7 vans exploding next to some walls could flood the whole city, making the people not just like... maybe go to the third floor of the building they are next to, but rush into the Madison Square Garden of Gotham, so that Riddler's 15 tiktok followers could start shooting at them was just... what?

"3 hours of Batman saying less than 20 lines. My biggest worry before starting this film was Robert Pattinson as Batman. Instead, by the end I felt bad for him. It's excruciatingly slow and by the time you get to the parts you're supposed to be excited or care about, you're over it. You may think, ""Let's keep going, it'll get better."" Don't waste your time, it doesn't. They could have killed half the main characters and I wouldn't have cared at all. In fact, it would have resulted in less people taking up pointless time and made the movie move quicker.

Pattison is only 6 foot and weighs a buck seventy wet Where he's officially listed as 6'2 and 210lbs. Throw on another 20 lbs of armor. That's the average size of a linebacker in the NFL.Beyond any of that the film is slow, it's barely up to snuff on the technical merits - lighting is bad, editing sub-par and it's pacing sucks. It's easily 30 minutes to long with all kinds of extraneous crap in it that should have been cut.However where it fails, and outright offends, is Hollywood once again pushing their radical leftist agenda and racism and misandry against white men.

Robert Pattinson is a good choice for Batman, for he is so moody and mysterious. The use of music was also very good, low key and creepy. This is the kind of movie I can watch over and over again.

"Was not a fan at all, my biggest fear going in was Pattinson as Batman, he did very well and my complaints aren't with him at all. His Batman characters stinks however, but he didn't write it only acted it. Allow me to elaborate complaints below.1. Batman's soft and weak, it literally opens with Batman asking if what he's doing is even worth it. If you're a longtime Batman fan you know that's just not the character in any other form of media, other movies included. Sure some villains make him wonder himself, but not a ""crime wave"" that he hears about on the news... Also this is kinda little but at one point he's pushing a table across a floor and lets out an audible grunt! This man swings through the city with a grapple hook but can't slide a table... Literally weak in his portrayal, not figuratively.2. Villains stink, Riddler feels like an edgy reddit user who you would never believe could pull of the elaborate plans he does. Definitely not cool witty riddler, seems like theyre trying to show how dangerous the anon ""chan"" style websites are and it just feels so transparent and played out.2b. The Penguin and Falcone are caricatures of old Italian mobsters. Not believable at all... These Tony Bolognas can't get through a sentence without a ""Ayyyy, Ohhh"" or something along those lines, I was just waiting for a ""I'm walking here!"". Genuinely had my friends and I laughing at the theater.3. Old writers trying to play to young people. At one point commissioner Gordon says ""The Riddler's video has gone ViRaL!"" and then several scenes later they say in a completely serious tone, ""He's got almost 500 followers"". Clearly seems like someone trying to be modern when they're just not... Also, Catwoman, ""White Privilege"", c'mon. Another quote that had my friends and I laughing in the theaters, your political points in a movie about an adult dressing up and punching people aren't necessary. Remember when movies were great escapism? This movie doesn't. Lol and none of the political points are any different than the status quo, you're not breaking ground or sharing some new age opinion, please just stop.To wrap it up the movie just isn't good. Politics aside I just don't like the vision they were going for. A weak, non-confident, sadboy, Batman. Again, I don't blame this on Pattinson as it was acted very well. Just a horrible idea on the story telling side.

"Sadly, I couldn't get the chance to watch it in theaters. But even at home, the Batman is still an really strong movie, that I thoroughly enjoyed.I really liked the direction Matt Reeves took this version of Batman, making him a detective. It works really well with the story, and also matches his more violent nature, thanks to the performance of Robert Pattison, who does a great job as Batman.The Story was also solid too. The main problem is that it was too long, and could've had about 15-20 minutes cut to make it tighter. But even with that, the story is still engaging, and is an is an intriguing and fun mystery to follow. Also, the cinematography and action were stunning, thanks to Greig Fraser.The characters were also solid. I liked the arch Bruce Wayne/Batman went on, discovering his parent's past, and learning to acknowledge the past, but also focus on the future. Zoe Kravitz also does a good job, but when the third act hinges on Batman and Selina Kyle's romance, it didn't work for me, because they didn't have the best chemistry.

The fight scenes are deplorable, he gets away with things mostly out of luck (car pursuit, neck bomb explosion, point blank shotgun to the chest, all these scenes portrayed 0 Batman skills).Third, why oh why is it so depressing haha Batman is supposed to be dark and filled with anger/sorrow, not be a depressed man-child.Lastly, a useless and ridiculous Alfred... you're a butler mate.

But after some time I collected my thoughts and here they are.First of all the movie is awesome. It's something I can't remember seeing in superhero movies. Yes there are details that were brought from Fincher and Nolan and some others. But it feels like it has its own unique world, different from its predecessors.The actors performance is superb.Although the movie is supposed to be a neo noir detective, a lot of mysteries Batman uncovers not through analysing, investigating or putting up clues together but by getting exposition(talking) from characters he visits.Overall the screenplay feels raw, and editing unfinished.

"In this nine-hundredth installment of the same old story there's a man in a heavy cape trying very hard to keep it from flapping around when he's running and fighting. My advice: lose the cape.There's also a young lady with very long nails and severe anorexia who weighs eighty-three pounds with her designer boots on and somehow manages to take down men three times her size - but can't shoot her deadbeat dad in a barrel.

His Batman is Very broody, confused and a detective. The problem with the movie, which I enjoyed mostly, is that it's too long by about 30 minutes. There was one murder after another after another and the Batman on the trail to figure them all out. Movie should have ended with the Riddler going to jail (spoiler!) and talking to his jailmate, which it turns out to be the Joker.

"Outstanding cast and performances, but lacked proper directing and good editing. The director fails to let the characters actors engage the audience. There just is not enough for the viewer to have an emotional connection with the main characters. Bruce Wayne is shallow. His portrayal lacks any substance. You would think at almost three hours, there would be a little more time spent on his personal and professional life to develop the character more fully. Instead the viewer has to endue long over drawn shots and little much else. Batman is only motivated by revenge and even that is not well presented. Where is the love? I just don't feel the love. The Wayne Manner is a hollow cave; there is nothing wealthy looking about it. Who would want to live there? The bat mobile, are you kidding me! The bat mobile is much more than a street legal dragster. I like Colin Farrell's acting, but not as the Penguin, which has little to offer. I guess after the magnificent portrayal of the Penguin by actor Robin Lord Taylor in Gotham; very few actors will be able to develop the character so well. Too bad Robin Lord Taylor wasn't reprising his roll in this film. Zoe Kravitz performance is well done, but something was missing. Selina Kyle portrayal is shallow and hard to relatable too. Selina's relationship with her friend needed a little more depth to justify her motivation for revenge for her murder. If there is any actor on the big screen who has potential that has not been tapped into, it is Zoe Kravitz. She should be given a lead role that her talent can shine. I think she could light up the big screen if a director would give her the right script and part. Paul Dano spends way too much time behind the mask, we just don't see enough of him which is a waste of his talent. His acting ability allows him to capture the personality of who ever he plays. He can be really convincing creep, but in this film he is on the sideline most of the time hidden behind a mask!. This movie feels like under-cooked French sulfa that just didn't rise, and leaves me asking 'Is that all?""",outstanding cast performance lacked proper directing good editing director fails let character actor engage audience enough viewer emotional connection main character bruce wayne shallow portrayal lack substance would think almost three hour would little time spent personal professional life develop character fully instead viewer endue long drawn shot little much else batman motivated revenge even well presented love feel love wayne manner hollow cave nothing wealthy looking would want live bat mobile kidding bat mobile much street legal dragster like colin farrell acting penguin little offer guess magnificent portrayal penguin actor robin lord taylor gotham actor able develop character well bad robin lord taylor reprising roll film zoe kravitz performance well done something missing selina kyle portrayal shallow hard relatable selina relationship friend needed little depth justify motivation revenge murder actor big screen potential tapped zoe kravitz given lead role talent shine think could light big screen director would give right script part paul dano spends way much time behind mask see enough waste talent acting ability allows capture personality ever play really convincing creep film sideline time hidden behind mask movie feel like cooked french sulfa rise leaf asking,positive,825

"So every 10 years another one comes along, making it quite hard to reinvent. Unfortunately, this version plods along too slowly, taking too long, with a dark brooding aesthetic that is just soporific. The action and fighting is limited. There is no real batcave imagined and Batman's gadgets are not outstanding, especially the car that makes an appearance that felt unneeded at that time. The plot could have been smarter, as could the Riddler's riddles, with loose connections that were unbelievable. The cast is surprisingly mixed of good US and UK actors, but none of the characters move out of being quite one dimensional. Pattinson is reasonably good as Batman but quite flat as Bruce Wayne. The cinematography tries too hard to create visually iconic scenes, like the flare rescue at the end, which actually add nothing to save this dreary version.

"When the Mayor of Gotham is brutally killed and the Batman is named at the crimescene, it sets off a chain of events that proceed to pull apart the fragile infrastructure that keeps both the city of Gotham and the Batman upright.Thankfully, Matt Reeves isn't interested in ""rebooting"" the Batman's story, instead opting to explore the darker crevices of the masked crusader/detective's mind and impulses. Two years into the game (as told by Robert Pattinson in VO) sees petty criminals stain their britches whenever that light comes on above the city of Gotham and start running from the shadows, into the bright city lights. Sadly, crime is up and Batman isn't sure if he's making a positive difference (other than boosting cleaning services for whites). By the end of this near-on 3 hour epic noir, he'll have something that resembles an answer.Notable rogues swirl around the maelstrom Batman creates as he searches for Riddler. Colin Farrell, Zoe Kravitz and John Turturro are each unrecognisable in their roles. Paul Dano is Paul Dano at his most Paul Danoist. Penguin, Catwoman, Carmine Falcone and Maroni are all accounted for, each taking on the sort of role you'd expect in a noir genre film (the unseen kingpin, the power hungry dog, the vengeful femme fatale and the oft referenced maguffin). Riddler seems to be in another film altogether, playing the role of Jigsaw, John Doe and any number of SNS incels who are seconds from inciting mass murder as acts of terrorism. Bruce Wayne may also be an incel here, with all the charm of a broken table and the social skills that match. Lines between the Riddler and the Batman are deliciously blurred as they both indulge in similar voyeuristic tendencies, taking their victims in similar manners and doing everything they can do to stay hidden, while also seeking infamy.The set is glorious and detailed. Gotham resembles a timeless city and, yet, at the same time, a gothic art deco nightmare. Dingy club scenes cut to glamorous sitting rooms. Wayne Tower melts from cavernous hellhole to claustraphobic luxury and tradition. Among it all, crime scenes menace and shadows spread out over pale, sick streetlights. Brief respites of light as the sun rises or sets over Gotham give the film a boost of romance before Batman once again dives off the roofs of buildings and stalks tunnels.But, damn it's dark. It's so dark you can imagine the designer who painstakingly built this beautiful horror of a city fuming that none of the detail is seen for long. Reeves trains his camera to linger on Pattinson and the score, at times excellent, betrays a level of self-importance that, honestly, the subject matter doesn't deserve. Superheroes, and men running around in capes, should never be treated as anything other than the camp escapism they offer from the world, and, unfortunately, too often The Batman puffs out his chest and declares his legitimacy undeservingly. As the film nears the ending, the fatigue of seeing what is nothing more than a bombastic take on Se7en crawl to the 3 hour mark proves too much and I imagine a lot of audiences will be squirming impatiently for the credits to roll. Sadly, we've got numerous monologues and references to potential sequels to listen to, first.Still, it's never not fun to see Batman roll up to the club and beat up a pair of twins who have the same MO everytime the door opens. It's always a good time to see The Batman get nuts and growl. It's always exciting to see Catwoman weigh her options to put the hurt on the Bat or sleep with him. And whenever that Batmobile roars through a firey pile up in pursuit of a maniac, it's hard, even after countless iterations, not to be giddy about the hurt coming to whichever criminal thought they could outrun him.Too many tricks, not enough treats, and nowhere near enough light (both figurative and literal) for this Halloween outing for Batman, though, prevents it reaching the heights of Batman Returns or The Dark Knight. But as an antidote to the Marvel mill that continues to push the same story in different clothes (you can practically hear Disney yell ""Representation!"" with every retelling of Iron Man), seeing Batman choose to help citizens rather than get the bad guy in the hopes of bettering a broken city is a refreshing angle and one I wouldn't mind finding out the answer to.",mayor gotham brutally killed batman named crimescene set chain event proceed pull apart fragile infrastructure keep city gotham batman upright thankfully matt reef interested rebooting batman story instead opting explore darker crevice masked crusader detective mind impulse two year game told robert pattinson vo see petty criminal stain britches whenever light come city gotham start running shadow bright city light sadly crime batman sure making positive difference boosting cleaning service white end near hour epic noir something resembles answer notable rogue swirl around maelstrom batman creates search riddler colin farrell zoe kravitz john turturro unrecognisable role paul dano paul dano paul danoist penguin catwoman carmine falcone maroni accounted taking sort role expect noir genre film unseen kingpin power hungry dog vengeful femme fatale oft referenced maguffin riddler seems another film altogether playing role jigsaw john doe number sn incels second inciting mass murder act terrorism bruce wayne may also incel charm broken table social skill match line riddler batman deliciously blurred indulge similar voyeuristic tendency taking victim similar manner everything stay hidden also seeking infamy set glorious detailed gotham resembles timeless city yet time gothic art deco nightmare dingy club scene cut glamorous sitting room wayne tower melt cavernous hellhole claustraphobic luxury tradition among crime scene menace shadow spread pale sick streetlight brief respite light sun rise set gotham give film boost romance batman dive roof building stalk tunnel damn dark dark imagine designer painstakingly built beautiful horror city fuming none detail seen long reef train camera linger pattinson score time excellent betrays level self importance honestly subject matter deserve superheroes men running around cape never treated anything camp escapism offer world unfortunately often batman puff chest declares legitimacy undeservingly film nears ending fatigue seeing nothing bombastic take se en crawl hour mark prof much imagine lot audience squirming impatiently credit roll sadly got numerous monologue reference potential sequel listen first still never fun see batman roll club beat pair twin mo everytime door open always good time see batman get nut growl always exciting see catwoman weigh option put hurt bat sleep whenever batmobile roar firey pile pursuit maniac hard even countless iteration giddy hurt coming whichever criminal thought could outrun many trick enough treat nowhere near enough light figurative literal halloween outing batman though prevents reaching height batman return dark knight antidote marvel mill continues push story different clothes practically hear disney yell representation every retelling iron man seeing batman choose help citizen rather get bad guy hope bettering broken city refreshing angle one mind finding answer,positive,840

"This one took me a little while to get my thoughts clear on it. This movie, more than most feels like a balancing act. There are things about this that I LOVED but then there are things I HATED to counter them.The Good. This may be the best Batman in a movie yet. I loved the way they had him interacting with the police, the way they had him actually showing detective skills and working out problems and solving puzzles. The gear he uses, the suit, it all felt within that realm of believable without being cartoon-y. There are moments when the cinematography is just stunning, as is the sound design. Serkis continues to prove he may be one of the more underrated people in Hollywood. Lastly, Gotham felt like its own city. A mythical place where things are constantly one degree away from being the Purge.The Not-So-Good. While the cinematography is sometimes amazing there are other times when things were so dark it was hard to keep track of what was going on. The movies is long. Really long and it felt like some things could be cut out. Hate to say it, but I feel like Catwoman could've been given significantly less screen time or removed entirely and it wouldn't have harmed the film all that much. While I think this may be one of the best Batman performances, R-Pats as Bruce Wayne wasn't really doing it for me. He kept reminding me of the Penguin in Gotham or Johnny Depp in Dark Shadows.The Bad. I hated the villain here. I get what they're going for but everything about him just annoyed me and rubbed me the wrong way. I don't know the comics well enough to recognize if this is some iteration of the character, some popular version I'm just not familiar with but WOW did I not like a single moment of them on screen. This leads, invariably, to the ending. They took a swing. I appreciate that they did but it just landed with a thud for me. I'm referring to the climactic finish as well as some of the final shots that just screamed of basic film-making.At the end though, despite feeling very torn as I walked out of the theater, I had the realization that I would love to see this Batman again.

This Batman also shows way too much emotion and isn't quite an enigma. The Batman, its so boring and unworthy movie, why why keep changing batman?

"Any batman film released now will be naturally compared to previous Batman films and this one wasn't as enjoyable or impactful for me. I will start by saying Tim Burtons Batman film with Michael Keaton and Nolans The Dark Knight are my two favourite Batman films to date.I saw Matt Reeves The Batman last night in a busy theatre.. First I will talk about the positives.Gotham looks great, it's gritty, it's crime ridden and its dark. Corruption and crime is clearly evident like you would expect.Robert Patterson actually did a better job then I thought as Batman. I went in wondering how he would pull it off. I wondered if he had bulked up for this role and it doesn't look like it. Not your typical built muscular build but he pulled off the role of Batman for me enough. (Bruce Wayne is another story and I discuss that in thr negatives)
The fight scenes were done well and these moments were appreciated although I have negatives regarding no blood making them fall flat for me once they finished.The Riddler is dark and scary enough to a degree.The castings of Alfred, Cat Woman, Penguin all OKish.The club scenes with lights and music brought an energy needed after many dull moments.Thats where the positives end and the negatives quickly outweigh the positives.Firstly this is a 15 certificate in the UK, there was absolutely no blood in the fight scenes. There's even a scene where a wounded Batman has an adrenaline shot to get up and he repeatedly punches a masked bad guy in the face in a brutal Manner. Batman is stopped and they remove the bad guys mask and there's no blood. It's just so unrealistic. The fight scenes lack the grit that is portrayed on the city and feel they are going for in this movie. Why dumb down the blood or graphic fights / kills? I feel the movie wants to be gritty on one side and very dumbed down on the other.All dark gritty scenes imply something without showing the actual execution of it such as Riddlers victims deaths... You see the setup and no execution. Left me feeling flat.Now let me address the length of this film, at nearly three hours long it gets very tiresome and I could sense others in the theatre fidgeting and feeling the same.Theres a lot of dialogue and overly drawn out scenes, it's simply to long in my opinion.Bruce Wayne is near enough non existent, hardly any Bruce Wayne and for the short times you see Robert Patterson as Bruce there's not much there.Its not a movie I enjoyed sadly and not one I would be eager to rewatch. I really wanted to like it more.",batman film released naturally compared previous batman film one enjoyable impactful start saying tim burton batman film michael keaton nolans dark knight two favourite batman film date saw matt reef batman last night busy theatre first talk positive gotham look great gritty crime ridden dark corruption crime clearly evident like would expect robert patterson actually better job thought batman went wondering would pull wondered bulked role look like typical built muscular build pulled role batman enough bruce wayne another story discus thr negative fight scene done well moment appreciated although negative regarding blood making fall flat finished riddler dark scary enough degree casting alfred cat woman penguin okish club scene light music brought energy needed many dull moment thats positive end negative quickly outweigh positive firstly certificate uk absolutely blood fight scene even scene wounded batman adrenaline shot get repeatedly punch masked bad guy face brutal manner batman stopped remove bad guy mask blood unrealistic fight scene lack grit portrayed city feel going movie dumb blood graphic fight kill feel movie want gritty one side dumbed dark gritty scene imply something without showing actual execution riddlers victim death see setup execution left feeling flat let address length film nearly three hour long get tiresome could sense others theatre fidgeting feeling there lot dialogue overly drawn scene simply long opinion bruce wayne near enough non existent hardly bruce wayne short time see robert patterson bruce much movie enjoyed sadly one would eager rewatch really wanted like,negative,850

Zoe Kravitz is a bad actress, and Turturro is a good actor who did not deserve such a weak role and poor dialogues.

"I did not expect much from yet any other ""reinvention"" of the franchise... is it the 4th or 5th now ? I lose count. This one will stick out for easily being the worst batman movie of the last decades. Not really all that easy after Zak Snyder... But compared to the Nolan or Burton Movies... oh my.This tripe is too long (2:56h including credis) , threadbare of any logic (ok, I do not expect much at all in a superhero movie, but how can a city flood if it's seawalls - does the screenwriter actually know what those are (?) - break while at the same time being several meters above the tide ? Why does the view from Wayne Manor change with every take... we will never know.... explosions at point blank range ? Many more WTH moments but : ""spoilers"" )
Supposedly intelligent, People just believing everything suspects tell them, even obviously hardened criminals and professional liars without even a shred of evidence... ( hey isn't this sold as a ""detective"" story ?).Even kids in faerie tales are more suspicious or analytical than super detective Bruce Wayne. Ok, well many people are the same with politicians, but this is a supposedly smart hero, right ?The story fails to engage on every level, unless Batman vs serial SAW-imitator is your thing...The score is overdone in a post operatic style, no comparison to Hans Zimmer's phenomenal OST for the Nolan movies which added to the overall impact of the dark knight movies . This one is utterly forgettablePattinson is utterly overrated as an actor (always has been, pretty faces are a dime a dozen, acting talent though, is obviously not ) and probably the worst pick for a hard, gritty noir detective in the last 30 years, especially with the director trying to pull off the tragic rock star vibe and the emotionally broken soul. Same goes for Zoe Kravitz, pretty, yes but not especially talented on the acting end, her ability express motivation or emotion is really limited.I pity the decent side cast of actually good actors stuck into sidekick roles and I hope Andy Serkis, Colin Farrell, Peter Sarsgaard, John Turturro etc at least got a decent paycheck out of this. The cast is - very zeitgeisty- diverse, yay for that. Sadly this adds nothing or at least good actors to the story. Compare this version of ""Commissioner Gordon"" to say, Gary Oldman take on it in the Nolan moviesAs for the length - far too long, given the basic and trite story especially since basically no time is spend with any background, motivation, or explaining or diversifying anything instead spending too much time on ""moody"" shots that go nowhere.Overall :
Utter waste of money, wish I could get my money back.

"... must work for the film company. First, I was prepared to give Patterson the benefits of the doubt, but don't believe the hype, he doesn't pull off the role. Second... this movie is way too slow. The pacing is well off. Even when there are action scenes RP can't home a candle to John Wick and you'll feel like you'd be better off watching that. Third, pc bases are covered with a kick ass back woman with attitude and a black Gordon.... Yaaaaaaaaaaawnnnnn. She adds nothing to the story and he can't act that well. But that suits this movie well cos neither can the star. Lastly, typically in all modern movies because most can't act they reduce themselves to whispering, which they think equates to gravitas and 'dramatic acting', no.. it just makes you have to turn the volume was up to have your ears blasted when the sound effects and action one along. Why can't modern movies get the balance right. Where did we lose this skill. Watch any pre 1980s movie and you will never struggle to hear what the actors are saying. Ever. It's not a terrible m'obie. But it's a movie with absolutely zero personality. The characters in their film noire style are just bland versions of all that have come before. I liked the take on the Penguins, but not even Batman's new Nirvana theme tune can't save it. The Dark Knight Trilogy still rules supreme.

"If the sequel features Joaquin Phoenix, Robert Pattinson might be the best counterpart. Batman and Joker have to be similar in too many ways - intensely dissatisfied with the world, dramatically altered appearance, drastic steps to compensate, yet different final solutions. This Batman focuses on the psychological aspect, which has the potential for a compelling sequel.Sadly, however, this Batman lacks in so many categories. The fights were neither realistic, nor particularly interesting. The detective work was fundamentally lacking - throwing some tech and reading the next page in the script is not detective work. The romantic component was just sort of, there, without illuminating any significant component of either character, nor advancing their arcs in any meaningful fashion. And what was his motivation again? I am...fear? Darkness? Vengeance? Why does he want to embody an emotion again? While I haven't seen the Twilight series, if Batman starts to sparkle in the sequel, I'm shutting off the movie and not finishing it.This was the best Riddler we've seen - brutal, deliberate, and sharing a compelling similar backstory to our hero. Still lacking a bit in overall development, as we don't know how/why he learned violence was the answer to his problems. Additionally, we can only surmise why he blames society at large, hence the targeting in the finale.Additionally, the tactics were laughably miserable. Batman is bulletproof? So long as it hits the right spot? And he calculates these tanks how? What about the magic ramp in the fire car chase? Sounds more like luck than tactical brilliance. Wasn't the traditional Batman known for his planning?And what in the world were they thinking introducing Catwoman last second in the final fight? When seconds matter, she's got minutes to change into costume, scale high above the fight, and swoop in at the perfect angle to catch the shotgun guy who just so happens to want to relish his shot against an otherwise tactically brilliant target they couldn't hit when they weren't relishing their shot. So incredibly dumb as to pull you out of the experience entirely.There's some serious potential for exploring a dive into madness, and deliberately solving your way out. I have a feeling they'll do it with a montage and soundtrack instead, but would really like to see useful grounding psychological techniques for escaping madness.",sequel feature joaquin phoenix robert pattinson might best counterpart batman joker similar many way intensely dissatisfied world dramatically altered appearance drastic step compensate yet different final solution batman focus psychological aspect potential compelling sequel sadly however batman lack many category fight neither realistic particularly interesting detective work fundamentally lacking throwing tech reading next page script detective work romantic component sort without illuminating significant component either character advancing arc meaningful fashion motivation fear darkness vengeance want embody emotion seen twilight series batman start sparkle sequel shutting movie finishing best riddler seen brutal deliberate sharing compelling similar backstory hero still lacking bit overall development know learned violence answer problem additionally surmise blame society large hence targeting finale additionally tactic laughably miserable batman bulletproof long hit right spot calculates tank magic ramp fire car chase sound like luck tactical brilliance traditional batman known planning world thinking introducing catwoman last second final fight second matter got minute change costume scale high fight swoop perfect angle catch shotgun guy happens want relish shot otherwise tactically brilliant target hit relishing shot incredibly dumb pull experience entirely serious potential exploring dive madness deliberately solving way feeling montage soundtrack instead would really like see useful grounding psychological technique escaping madness,positive,866

Not as very good like Tim Burton's take or great like Christoptor Nolan's take but way better then Joel Schumacher take.On accuracy Ben Afflecks Batman still looks more accurate live action of batman overall and batman tas is still the greatest batman epiction of batman ever but with the batman 2022 film? I get its a new take on batman based on year two and the long Halloween a beginning stages of his mission but just didn't look and feel accurate to me and it's way to grounded and overly pacey It didn't feel completely like a superhero/crime action movie which I feel batman should be it's more like a mystery thriller film like seven and silents of the lambs in it style.The casting it just wasn't accurate to the characters and i've watched every batman animation film show video game popular comic book and film and it wasn't there! But the actors did a great job Robert pattinson played a ok batman a batman who is evolving in the role but it's way too grounded for my taste and his pretrial of Bruce Wayne was not correct Bruce Wayne is supposed to be a gimmick a persona of a humble charming charitable billionaire playboy not seen as serious to his enemies that is how he keeps his identity secret even in his beginning stages straight off he adopts this persona if you read year one and watched batman begins and phantasm! Didn't see it here just saw the same guy with the same brooding expression just without the mask everyone of batman rouges gallery would easily see though it, Andy Circus didn't feel or sound or look like a Alfred! He just wasn't posh proper sophisticated
jeevey and domestic enough, Jeffrey wright's Jim Gordon wasn't accurate at all but his a great actor just didn't see him as Jim Gordon just Jeffrey wright, Zoe kraitz didn't feel like a Catwoman the high profile jewellery thief just a babe with a vendetta but her preferences was good, Paul Dano as ridder didn't totallly feel like ridder the riddles and messages yes but costume and attitude wasn't there he wasn't vain enough the character in every comic games and shows his unbelievably vain and Colin Farrell as penguin was good make up was amazing won't no it was him but penguin was not accurate to me no hat no ciger no birds no umbrella's or tuxedo or fur bomber jacket and wasn't short enough.I don't like identity politics in films like this it's uncomfortable, the fight scenes fell flat this batman in his fight scenes was super struggling to take even one bad guy down and didn't use any batarangs and the final act was confusing which annoyed me alot batman didn't solve the case to catch the villian because the ridder did a seven and gave himself up to then fluid the city a new York type city? WHAT! How?.The plot is a complete mess! So this batman his been batman for two and he his taken the mob down that is the first thing he does when he becomes batman and how does he form a relationship with Jim GordonBut other then that the good bits Gotham city looked great the batcar was good loved the contract lens to document his adventures and theme is excellent but I get it a new take but for me it wasn't accurate to the characters the ending and fight scenes fell flat and the plot was paced but it was a ok decent mystery thriller batman film, really annoys me we got this batman, when the Ben Affleck Batman was really much perfect it's sad. This batman film was med anyone one that says it was the best Batman movie ever is a liar or just brainless simps simping for a film because it has Batman as the title, I can see some fans genuinely Liked it but I didn't because it was not accurate to the characters the film was too long full of plot holes logic holes plaguing it if this Batman wasn't in the film nothing in the film would change, This film is generic and not a masterpiece!

"A great cinematic experience, although with some flaws mostly in narrative and structural sense.This really feels like a true Batman movie , and Pattinson is a right fit for it.Every single person involved in making this did exceptional job and poured their hearts in it, but major props should go to the score/cinematography/makeup team.Like everyone has said before, it is so refreshing to have a 'superhero' genre crafted on this level and looking like real cinema.Functions really well when it is a procedural thriller, but isn't that interesting when it focuses on its mob subplots...
Overall story isnt anything we haven't seen before and doesn't push the genre in any new way, it's just fine for what it is. It also becomes too convoluted towards the end.3 hour runtime is not entirely earned , but it isn't felt that much due to immersive world.Pacing loses some steam in the long second act before it picks up again towards the end. And even with this runtime some characters and relations remain underdeveloped (Alfred especially)
There aren't many memorable setpieces or scenes.(besides maybe the batmobile chase)All in all, a very, very good foundation for everything to come in this universe, from spin-offs to full trilogy.P.s. Colin Farrell really nailed it by totally disappearing in his character with both his acting and mask.",great cinematic experience although flaw mostly narrative structural sense really feel like true batman movie pattinson right fit every single person involved making exceptional job poured heart major prop go score cinematography makeup team like everyone said refreshing superhero genre crafted level looking like real cinema function really well procedural thriller interesting focus mob subplots overall story isnt anything seen push genre new way fine also becomes convoluted towards end hour runtime entirely earned felt much due immersive world pacing loses steam long second act pick towards end even runtime character relation remain underdeveloped alfred especially many memorable setpieces scene besides maybe batmobile chase good foundation everything come universe spin offs full trilogy p colin farrell really nailed totally disappearing character acting mask,positive,874

"I went to go see ""The Batman"" early for the IMAX Fan First event and it just blew my mind! The best way I can describe it is that it was ""The Dark Knight"" Trilogy meets detective crime drama meets psychological horror movie. I love how everything connects too. The casting was perfect! Robert Pattinson was an awesome Batman and he and ZoÃ« Kravitz had amazing chemistry together. Paul Dano's Riddler lit up the screen whenever he appeared and he was a great villain. Honestly, the most underrated part of this movie has to be Colin Farrell's Penguin. The makeup team did an amazing job with him and whenever he was onscreen, you couldn't see Colin Farrell, all you saw was Penguin. Jeffery Wright's Jim Gordon and Andy Serkis' Alfred were pretty good as well. The visuals are spectacular and I really do love the creative vision that Matt Reeves had for this movie. Also, the whole theater (myself included) freaked out when they teased Barry Keoghan as Joker near the end of the movie. The whole thing was just too good to put into words. And as shocking as this is, this might actually be better than ""The Dark Knight"", which before seeing this was my favorite movie of all time.

"There are no words to describe how bad this movie is. But to sum it up I can try to list some main problems: 1) It is two times two long, 2) Even if it was half shorter it would be bad, 3) Robert Pattinson is the absolute worst Batman ever and an even worse Bruce Wayne, 4) There is nothing good in this movie.Well, the only good aspect might be that it is not a cgi fest like Marvel movies. There is potential to make a more physical street fighting Batman film.But every character is terrible. Pattinson is the worst Batman ever. I kind of liked him in Twilight, he was okay. But he looks dumb in that new bat hood and super horrible without it - he's an EMO kid even worse than Jared Leto's Joker in Suicide Squad.

"The darkest and grittiest and most real Marvel/DC film so far second to Joker. I am not a fan of the superhero films because most of them aren't good films. But Joker was a brilliant character-led film and the Batman similarly tries something new and this must be appreciated. It aims for more darkness and grit and more of a real-world feel than typical superhero movies. And unlike most, it had an actual story of believable and interesting emotional and personal development - Batman evolving from being driven solely from revenge into a more hopeful symbol for the people of Gotham. And the soundtrack was amazing, it carries the tone of the movie beautifully, and in its own right it is wonderful music that I have been listening to ever since.

"This movie was painful to watch;
1. It was way to long for the material. This come from someone who has watched the extended version of Lord Of The Rings (trilogy) twice.2. It was monotone. It never drew me in or had me emotionally invested. I never connected with the characters.3. Batman was brooding and sulking, like a spoiled child, throughout the whole movie. The constant long masked head shots, vacant of expression, were not revelatory in the least.4. Actors like Jeffrey Wright did not fit the part and were awkward to watch.5. There were many disjointed scenes of violence that did not flow well.6. I like dark movies but this one never had the contrast necessary to appreciate the meaning of darkness.7. Costumes were even odd often feeling out of place.8. The pace was excruciatingly slow lending to the thin story being lost.9. Batman's lightbulb moment was more of a dim nightlight after sitting through hours knowing that's where this was all headed.10. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for someone to make a point ... make some sense out of the meandering conglomeration of Batman's silent antics. It never really happened.I have enjoyed all The Batman movies over the years especially the ones with Christian Bale. However this was, by far, the worst Batman movie I have ever seen and at the top of the list for one of the worst action/big budget movies I have ever watched.

"Just finished watching.The film sees The Batman facing off against The Riddler who plans to unleash devastation across the city!**MILD SPOILERS**I found the film to be boring, depressing & most importantly, too long at a staggeringly bad, 2 hours & 47 minutes. The dark tone while fitting was a bit too dark for its own good! Even the story itself was pretty blah and bleak.Much like the 90s Batman films, the hero's name is the title but the story is not about Batman....it's about Falcone and Selina and the Penguin and mostly it's about this Jigsaw version of Riddler. Joker is actually about Joker/Arthur Fleck. This movie really isn't about Batman/Bruce Wayne, except for about 20 minutes in the middle when Bruce grapples with his father's true character. Batman is constantly reacting to the Riddler, much like in the 90s Batman movies.Pattison was alright for Batman, but it was as if Edward Cullen was playing Batman....silent, brooding, emo, uninteresting, flat. Reminded me of Brandon Routh's Superman in Superman Returns in terms of being wooden and dull.All of the actors did fine, but it tries to be a detective story (with a Riddler who reminds you of Jigsaw and Seven) and an action/hero movie and a love story, and it just didn't engage me on any level....not enough to warrant almost 3 hours.Why did Riddler allow himself to be captured? In Seven it made sense, but here it doesn't. In the end he throws a hissy fit in his cell....but he allowed himself to be caught!!The Penguin scenes were great and I like this Penguin more than Danny Devito's sewer-dweller.Zoe Kravitz was fine but I didn't buy the love interest angle.The ending climax was okay but not nearly as fun and heroic as the finale of Batman Begins.It just felt like they were trying to conjure up Dark Knight vibes and I just didn't feel like Pattison's Batman was all that impressive. I wonder what this movie would have been with Ben Affleck's ominous Batman.The soundtrack, like most of the aspects of this movie, was fine, but not amazing. Not as good as Dark Knight soundtrack or even Danny Elfman Batman (1989) music.Overall, it's heavily overrated! It's too long, too boring & dull to the core with a weak story-line that's stretched to breaking point! Not as good as the Dark Knight, not as good as Batman (1989) or Batman Returns, and not even in the same league as Batman Begins or Ben Affleck's Batman.4/10.",finished watching film see batman facing riddler plan unleash devastation across city mild spoiler found film boring depressing importantly long staggeringly bad hour minute dark tone fitting bit dark good even story pretty blah bleak much like batman film hero name title story batman falcone selina penguin mostly jigsaw version riddler joker actually joker arthur fleck movie really batman bruce wayne except minute middle bruce grapple father true character batman constantly reacting riddler much like batman movie pattison alright batman edward cullen playing batman silent brooding emo uninteresting flat reminded brandon routh superman superman return term wooden dull actor fine try detective story riddler reminds jigsaw seven action hero movie love story engage level enough warrant almost hour riddler allow captured seven made sense end throw hissy fit cell allowed caught penguin scene great like penguin danny devito sewer dweller zoe kravitz fine buy love interest angle ending climax okay nearly fun heroic finale batman begin felt like trying conjure dark knight vibe feel like pattison batman impressive wonder movie would ben affleck ominous batman soundtrack like aspect movie fine amazing good dark knight soundtrack even danny elfman batman music overall heavily overrated long boring dull core weak story line stretched breaking point good dark knight good batman batman return even league batman begin ben affleck batman,positive,881
"It is hard to say what is most disappointing about this huge disappointment of a film. At first I thought it was the poorly lit sets, often, too often shot through rain spattered glass across streets dark, wet, but probably cheap to set up. I then changed my mind, no it was the sloppy B or even C grade direction allowing the actors to drift into scenes, mumble a few indistinct lines, then drift out of shot seemingly caring as little about the production as by now I did.Finally I worked it out, yes the director had given the whole effort the feel of a first year film school production, but no it was the poor casting and truly awful acting that stood out as the biggest let down.Who on earth thought it wise to cast Dano in this role ? His frankly pathetic screaming as a supposed illustration of a psychotic killer made me burst out laughing, it really was that bad.The whole offering is an embarrassment to the production company, the financial backers and people daft enough to give it any rating over 3.

"I'll be as brief as possible, and rather critical.Since...well, the atmosphere holds, the musical accompaniment, although only the park of tracks sounded throughout the film, Nirvana and something else, the picture is saturated, unlike Nolan's completely gray Batman, the characters are also sympathetic, which on really not a great plus in the piggy bank of the film. But kamon, I have never seen so many parodies of The Dark Knight 2008 in all this time!Please: there is a mental villain who is not directly involved in the physical confrontation with the main character! Reception with ""horror"" videos, yes! The villain's large-scale goal has come true, there is!And many more small parallels! Yes, of course, something is slightly different in my points, but the obvious reference to the dark knight, I think only the blind will not notice.And with all this, even though I frankly don't like Nolan's Batman, but when compared with the dark knight 2008, with which Batman Pattinson has the most similarities, then Nolan's Batman is a more philosophical film, more complexly structured, more serious, more psychological, more exciting, and so on!Well, it makes no sense, I think to compare the main villains, everything is clear here. Dano is good as the Riddler, but there is too little of him, and he does not reach the level of Ledger, in all aspects he does not reach.And one more thing, Reeves' Batman, well, let it be for me personally, is some strange quintessence of Batman of the 66th year and Nolan's Batman, because every time I caught, well, just the fiercest cringe when all of them solved these riddles according to the plot...
And all this is explained only by the fact that, ""well, here we have such a smart Bruce Wayne, and how and why he knows the answer to many riddles, this absolutely should not worry you""!!!)
Somehow it comes out...
Well, yes, from the Batman of the 60s in the new film there is a ton of cringe, and from Nolan's Batman it is gloomy and pathetic.In general, rather mixed and even strange emotions and feelings after the film....
How many strange decisions really were in it, and sometimes even some kind of awkward or something...I don't know...
The film is definitely good, but far from a masterpiece!The same Dark Knight 2008 is worked out many times better.And due to the numerous repetitions and frank parody of Batman Reeves can be called: a very good mediocrity, and nothing more.Well, you yourself think! I didn't name any of the cons, but there are many more! Please explain to me if someone knows how, how, in almost 3 hours of running time, he will not bother to reveal a single character??? How is that in general?? They didn't even try to open the main ones!Pros of the movie: Atmosphere!Weaknesses of the film: Bruce's ridiculous voice-over, completely unnecessary and leading nowhere, monotonous musical accompaniment, almost 3 hours in which nothing really is shown, linear and boring fuss, completely undeveloped characters, (I remind you, almost 3 hours!!) too fast development of the relationship between Batman and the Cat, lack of backstory and chemistry between them, the feeling that they are trying to somehow justify her presence in the film, the obvious borrowing of ideas from Nolan, VERY STUPID Batman, even the Penguin turned out to be smarter, and the ending is crumpled .. ..

"WHERE IS HE??????????Although it did follow the darkness that many DC movies have, The Batman's visual beauty is unparalleled. From the first moment he walked out of the shadow, Batman radiated the same energy as Darth Vader. Usually in movies you want to see things clearer in the light, but in this thriller, when the night comes, I know that I will be in awe.It's not surprising that this Batman had the best suit of all Batman. It added a lot to the largeness of the character. Robert Pattinson clearly proved that he was THE perfect Bruce. A common theme in Batman is that Bruce is a classy and beautiful rich man. However, here, he's a rich and insomniac young man. His look and struggle to solve the case turned him into an obsessive detective.I adore the direction of this movie to trim off a lot of the comic canon and instead follow a mystery thriller route. The Riddler transformed into the Zodiac killer, as he always should have been. Along with the fantastic scores, the psychopath kept the tension at high levels for the entirety of the runtime.As much as I love it, I don't think The Batman is a perfect movie.

"I loved this type of take on Batman, personally. I think that it's grounded in an alternate universe with a different, more realistic, perspective on the Batman origin story. Pattinson does the role justice, and there is good chemistry between him and Zoe Kravitz. The whole vibe of this movie is great and makes you feel the suspense and frightening nature that Batman really would give off. In short, this ain't comic book Batman, and it's not Clooney Batman either. It's real...er, deals with emotion, the inevitability of Batman getting seriously hurt, and emptiness that the character should have displayed in previous films.

"Maybe it was the rave reviews I kept hearing that got my expectations high but I just could not get into this film. Huge plot hole in never explaining how this Bruce Wayne learned to fight or where he got his gear. I understand Batman should be brooding and dark but that's why he created Batman.

"I'm not sure why this film is rated so high. I was mostly bored, wondering why we needed another Batman film.Some like the dark more gritty look, and I'm fine with that, but it has to come with full, rich characters and the story needs to be captivating. To me, this film had nothing of that. I feel it got overhyped by the initial trailer.The motivation of the Riddler was weak (I didn't believe for a moment that his reasoning of what was wrong with the city would lead to this master plan. His character was also completely unexplored and flat).The action was nice, but only brief moments of action exist, and felt unnecessary to the plot.Batman was not great - just a cranky guy in a cape, not much to identify with.Pretty bad despite the good art direction and cinematography.",sure film rated high mostly bored wondering needed another batman film like dark gritty look fine come full rich character story need captivating film nothing feel got overhyped initial trailer motivation riddler weak believe moment reasoning wrong city would lead master plan character also completely unexplored flat action nice brief moment action exist felt unnecessary plot batman great cranky guy cape much identify pretty bad despite good art direction cinematography,positive,901

"""The Batman"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch Batman trying to protect the citizens of Gotham from the Riddler, a sadistic serial killer who murders some politicians of the city.I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie but I happily surprised by it. It was different than the previous Batman movies, a bit darker and the action scenes were also captured from a different aspect. The plot of the movie was interesting and contained plenty of suspense but it also contained some very slow scenes that they could be sorter. The interpretation of Robert Pattinson who played as Bruce Wayne was good and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were ZoÃ« Kravitz's who played as Selina Kyle, Jeffrey Wright's who played as Lt. James Gordon, Andy Serkis' who played as Alfred and Paul Dano's who played as The Riddler.

"Watched ""The Batman"" with Pattison just now. I can see why there is some polarity, if you check user reviews, but personally, I quite liked it.I agree that Pattison is ""controversial"" here, mostly because of the looks. Batman is one of those characters (along with Judge Dredd), that requires an actor with... Articulate chin and lips. And let's be honest it's difficult to call Robert's face ""masculine"". He does compensate for that with eyes, though.But aside from the looks, some people may find his overall portrayal of the character as ""too brooding"". And I would agree, that the haircut and overall demeanor of his as ""Bruce Wayne in public"" is a bit emo-style and does not fit the character that well. But again - that's (mostly) the looks.In terms of everything else, though... I would dare say that it is somewhat realistic. Or at least ""the feel"" of it all is. And I think that's where all controversy is coming from: it's not ""comics"". Previously even Nolan's trilogy of ""Batman V Superman"", which were relatively ""dark"", were ""comics"". This movie does not feel like ""comics"" based. I dare say, that if you removed all the knowledge about the character, you would not think of it as ""comics-based"" after watching.It has that kind of atmosphere... I am not sure how to describe it. It reminds me of some movies, probably mockumentary ones or even those older ""prohibited"" ones. Like something slimy, but without the slime. Like lump of dead flesh falling on the floor, because it is a real dead flesh and not some prop, because it's a snuff movie. It's ""yucky"". Close to ""Irreversible"" kind of yucky, but not on the same level, because otherwise it would scare the audience from the theaters.That's not something most viewers were expecting, I am sure. But it fits.What made Batman comics stand out back in the day (and to an extent today without people realizing it) were characters, that had psychological traumas or disorders. They usually were not driven by something ephemeral, there was order behind the madness. That's what made ""The Joker"" movie a hit, if you think about it.And ""The Batman"" delivers the same thing, but also on the ""hero"". There are glimpses of his insanity here and there. And only glimpses of the motivation. There is not much of ""bravado"" from Batman besides ""I am vengeance"" very early in the movie. The man is clearly in a state similar to mixed states of bipolar: he is depressive, he sees the world very darkly, but yet he has signs of mania, because he thinks that he is the only one (or one of the few) who can change that.And I think this scares a lot of viewers. Because it makes the character ""too human"". Even more human than the what Ben Afflek delivered in his ""disappointed by life"" version of Batman. It's no longer a ""rock"" akin to Superman and is even more ""human"" than Spider-Man, which became a hit because Peter was very relatable to kids and young people.Almost everything in the movie was delivering this kind of feeling. Or at least I interpreted it that way. Sense of lifelessness behind the act of life, I guess. Do I find the movie ""the best ever""? Hell, no. I agree, that it may be too long, for example. I would probably prefer it as a TV Series. Or maybe a series of shorter movies, like ""Spawn"" animation, which had similar atmosphere, actually. But, personally, I would not mind a continuation of this version. In fact, I'd prefer it more than continuation of Nolan's action-packed trilogy even.",watched batman pattison see polarity check user review personally quite liked agree pattison controversial mostly look batman one character along judge dredd requires actor articulate chin lip let honest difficult call robert face masculine compensate eye though aside look people may find overall portrayal character brooding would agree haircut overall demeanor bruce wayne public bit emo style fit character well mostly look term everything else though would dare say somewhat realistic least feel think controversy coming comic previously even nolan trilogy batman v superman relatively dark comic movie feel like comic based dare say removed knowledge character would think comic based watching kind atmosphere sure describe reminds movie probably mockumentary one even older prohibited one like something slimy without slime like lump dead flesh falling floor real dead flesh prop snuff movie yucky close irreversible kind yucky level otherwise would scare audience theater something viewer expecting sure fit made batman comic stand back day extent today without people realizing character psychological trauma disorder usually driven something ephemeral order behind madness made joker movie hit think batman delivers thing also hero glimpse insanity glimpse motivation much bravado batman besides vengeance early movie man clearly state similar mixed state bipolar depressive see world darkly yet sign mania think one one change think scare lot viewer make character human even human ben afflek delivered disappointed life version batman longer rock akin superman even human spider man became hit peter relatable kid young people almost everything movie delivering kind feeling least interpreted way sense lifelessness behind act life guess find movie best ever hell agree may long example would probably prefer tv series maybe series shorter movie like spawn animation similar atmosphere actually personally would mind continuation version fact prefer continuation nolan action packed trilogy even,positive,910

"This movie couldn't decide what it should be: a brooding Batman movie, a mob movie, a serial killer drama, or a preachy social justice movie, so it was decided it would be a mash-up of all four.I'll agree with many of the posters here that it was overly long and quite depressing. I noticed that all the corrupt politicians, corrupt cops, mobsters, and main villains were all white males and Gotham City was rescued by heroic ""people of color"" along with the help of Batman. Bella Real even scolds Bruce Wayne for not being philanthropic enough even though his family gave $1 billion to Gotham City yet somehow it wasn't enough.How was Bella Real elected mayor when her opponent was murdered?

"I saw this last night, but I should have waited for it to transfer to a streaming platform. The Batman is long - too long. For all its dark, brooding chiselled chin-ness, it's a bit boring. Saving grace is its ""looks"" - It had more in common with the comic-book Batman - I half-expected speech bubbles to appear or onomatopoeic words to appear on screen in fight scenes. If that was the look the director, design team and cinematographer was going for, they did an amazing job. RP did his best with the role but ultimately, for me, he was unconvincing. There are 4 writers attributed to this script. Not sure what they all did but the result had me laughing out loud quite a few times. I mean how can anyone deliver a line like ""I'm here to see the penguin"" and not crack up? The main musical theme reminded me of the death star theme from Star Wars and was a tad OTT in my opinion.It wasn't in the same league as the last 3 Batman movies although it had many memorable and admirable elements.

"This in no way was a bad movie. Just a tad underwhelming. I went into this movie expecting some big Batman action, mixed with some detective work and a bit of mystery. Instead what I got was a Batman film that was more mystery then action. Not to say there wasn't great action in it, but it definitely took the back seat to the overall mystery. That is my first gripe with this movie. For a film that seems to be diving headfirst into the detective side of Batman, the mystery seemed half baked and underwhelming. Batman doesn't solve the case, it's pretty much spelled out for him. I liked how Bruce was still figuring out how to be the Batman, but he's supposed to have the skills first and the image later. Instead this Batman stumbles around any fight he's in, resulting in shots, punches, bombs and more hitting him point blank. Not that any of this hurts him, somehow his suit is resistant to every attack to his body. Miraculously, his exposed mouth and jaw are always in perfect shape though.This movie really shines through its character work. Bruce Wayne/Batman is great. Pattinson does a great job as a Bruce who isn't quite Batman yet. He is dark, emotional, and honestly quite scary to watch. His Alfred, played by Andy Serkis, was great as well. Through his limited screen time he portrayed a strong Alfred with a clear past in the military. Catwoman, played by Zoe Kravitz, was amazing as well. The best catwoman we've got on TV or Film yet. Colin Farell was unrecognizable as Penguin, and portrayed the character in a way that was almost exactly like the comics. Last but not least, Paul Dano ad Riddler. Riddler was terrifying, and maybe the best Batman villain on screen so far. He was amazing as a life-like serial killer that was great when juxtaposed to the Batman.Although I did have some complaints, I think The Batman mostly succeeds as what it set out to do. The sequel has the potential to improve greatly on what we have and become the best Batman series we've got so far.

"It rains a lot and it's dark as hell. The dialogue is weak, cartoonish, and the revelations predictable. It's unecesarrly long, you can cut an hour of it just by limiting the staring. What is the point of the emo batman look? I get the pain of the character but there are so many other ways of showcasing that, without the whole black eyes and vacant stare and stupid lines like ""you're not my father"" to Albert. Batman to me was supposed to be at least smart and physically capable of taking on some though criminals. This rendition of it feels like he is always one step behind all the time and that he couldn't even poke someone stick a stick even if they stood still.

"Reading through these reviews, it's clear to me that many people simply don't understand the hype with this movie. A couple things to note: Yes, the movie is extremely long (3hrs) and yes it moves at a very slow pace. For this reason I feel most people simply won't like it when other superhero flicks are packed with a steady storytelling method that moves the plot forward on a consistent time scale and enough action to get their heart racing.This version of Batman is done very differently. This prefers the story and the sensation of something lingering just out of sight in order to create an impending sense of doom. This is a far more serious movie than it's predecessors, foregoing the generic comedy bites to keep the mood light enough to prime the audience for the next action sequence.This feels more grounded than most other hero movies and this version of Batman even makes sense in a way, feeding you a tortured soul that walks a line between good and bad.Now, what makes this movie truly standout is the cinematography. The filmmakers choose to use the camera to tell the story and limit the amount of digital graphics or CGI in the film. This shows a real passion for cinematography and because of this, the quality of the film will hold up longer than those films leaning heavily on CGI. A great example of this is how the original Matrix cinematography surpasses all 3 of the sequels in visual integrity due to the camera angles and not the graphics.This Batman certainly isn't for everyone and that is okay, but the people giving this such poor reviews, I can only assume require instant gratification and don't much care whether the image on the screen is real or rendered.TLDR: Be patient and appreciate the art and storytelling that went into this film. It's masterful.",reading review clear many people simply understand hype movie couple thing note yes movie extremely long hr yes move slow pace reason feel people simply like superhero flick packed steady storytelling method move plot forward consistent time scale enough action get heart racing version batman done differently prefers story sensation something lingering sight order create impending sense doom far serious movie predecessor foregoing generic comedy bite keep mood light enough prime audience next action sequence feel grounded hero movie version batman even make sense way feeding tortured soul walk line good bad make movie truly standout cinematography filmmaker choose use camera tell story limit amount digital graphic cgi film show real passion cinematography quality film hold longer film leaning heavily cgi great example original matrix cinematography surpasses sequel visual integrity due camera angle graphic batman certainly everyone okay people giving poor review assume require instant gratification much care whether image screen real rendered tldr patient appreciate art storytelling went film masterful,positive,944

"With all the other Batman related films and series coming out I honestly felt that this film simply ended up in a much too crowded field. Okay, The Joker was a pretty good film, namely because it explored the idea of the creation of the Joker, however this one, to be honest with you, simply came across as basically just another Batman film. Actually, with the attempts at creating the DCEU (which seems to be failing rather abysmally, despite the fact that the films are actually making money) this film really actually felt somewhat out of place. This is also the case with the fact that I have been watching through episodes of Gotham. Another thing that jumped out at me was that Reeves basically seemed to be attempting to out Nolan Nolan, namely by making it darker and grittier than the Nolan films.Look, I'm not necessarily saying that this film was a bad film - by no means - and Robert Patterson does come across as Bruce Wayne really quite well. However, the problem with the film that it is coming on the heels of I really don't know how many series/movies - some of them actually quite recent, which basically means that Reeves is really trying to tread a really fine line so as not to come across as either being corny, or simply ripping off somebody else's material. Do I think he succeeded - no, not really.It isn't that I'm criticising what has eventually come out, and it is the case that yes, it has been very heavily influenced by Nolan's work, though it really just didn't feel as if it was coming from anywhere, or going anywhere. Sure, we have the Riddler playing in the background, and he is definitely the major villain of the peace - who is on a crusade to cleanse Gotham of its corruption. However we also have the Penguin, and Falcone, making an appearance.The catch is that I have been watching Gotham of late, which means that the series, and the film, sort of ended up clashing. Then there is also the comparrison with Nolan's masterpieces, and unfortunately Nolan has pretty much set a standard which is going to be a problem as well. In the end, while this does come about as a stand-alone film, the thing is that Batman is a franchise, and that the MCU has pretty much made it rather difficult to make standalone Superhero films, yet considering the nature of this particular film, it really doesn't feel as if it could fit into a campy extended universe, as is the case with the DCEU. Sure, it might be a little darker than the MCU, but compared with how dark this Batman film happens to be, it really doesn't seem to work.Look, I did like the film, and I can't criticise it too much, it is just that my issue is that it really did seem to come about with just a little too much baggage. Maybe it is just that I am starting to suffer from superhero fatigue.",batman related film series coming honestly felt film simply ended much crowded field okay joker pretty good film namely explored idea creation joker however one honest simply came across basically another batman film actually attempt creating dceu seems failing rather abysmally despite fact film actually making money film really actually felt somewhat place also case fact watching episode gotham another thing jumped reef basically seemed attempting nolan nolan namely making darker grittier nolan film look necessarily saying film bad film mean robert patterson come across bruce wayne really quite well however problem film coming heel really know many series movie actually quite recent basically mean reef really trying tread really fine line come across either corny simply ripping somebody else material think succeeded really criticising eventually come case yes heavily influenced nolan work though really feel coming anywhere going anywhere sure riddler playing background definitely major villain peace crusade cleanse gotham corruption however also penguin falcone making appearance catch watching gotham late mean series film sort ended clashing also comparrison nolan masterpiece unfortunately nolan pretty much set standard going problem well end come stand alone film thing batman franchise mcu pretty much made rather difficult make standalone superhero film yet considering nature particular film really feel could fit campy extended universe case dceu sure might little darker mcu compared dark batman film happens really seem work look like film criticise much issue really seem come little much baggage maybe starting suffer superhero fatigue,positive,947

"I love Se7en. It's my favorite detective noir movie. I also love everything Batman, whether it's Val Kilmer, Christopher Nolan, the game series or Gotham. You'd think a mix of the two would be my wet dream. Unfortunately this mix did not work out at all.As far as Se7en similarities go, it's pretty good. Interesting puzzles, nice pacing and atmosphere, not so great antagonist, though i blame that on the actor trying too hard to be...weird?The problems are on the Batman side. This batman is bad. He's introduced as a vigilante then spends most of the movie looking for clues, and when he has to fight at the end he gets his ass kicked (don't worry, it's not a spoiler). The fighting coreography is mediocre. This batman doesn't know how to use any of his fancy gear except for the grappling hook. Not to mention he goes into gun fights like Robocop and the results vary depending on what the screenwriter wanted.This movie also features probably the worst batmobile in any batman ever. His motorcycle is some slow old trash too, which is ironic because at the end he is seen driving a really nice one so what gives? Maybe he loses the old one at some point or it breaks down in some edited scene.Overall i can't recommend this movie to batman fans. Just wait until it's cheap to rent or buy.

"Batman (2022) was a reset of the Batman saga literally from the top with a lengthy epic length of almost 3 hours long. The first screen version of Batman was a TV series, a duet with a Boy Wonder sidekick which dated back to the 60's. That was a squeaky-clean version of ""POW!"" and ""KAPOW!"" knockouts of the bad guys. A superhero ""super"" because he and Boy Wonder were the accompaniments to maintaining law and order, which was suggestively beyond the arms of the Gotham police. As time progresses, the movie version of Batman took an interim turn to become bigger, with more fantastic super-toys, to the point where he had outgrown the need of Robin the Boy Wonder to become ""super"" solo on his own. A design needed to offset some equally more diabolical and more showy ""super"" villains. At that time, Gotham was still simplistically polar in its good vs. Bad, but as our real world evolved into more and more complex and dualistic sophistry of relativism, Gotham also evolved accordingly. Batman becomes the Dark Knight. No longer is he the Adam West version. Now he has a dark spot in his heart, and vengeance in his drive for justice. Who cares if he is not puritanically good as long as he shines over the darkness of greater evil? In this latest version, the line between good and evil has become even less distinguishable. It has become a question of who between Batman and the Riddler is the more acceptable vigilante? A question of who can claim the moral higher ground, a question which was also asked in the movie ""Seven"". As a movie, Robert Pattison makes a visually compelling Batman to look at, in spite of the short fall in the script. For as a character, he was written with the depth of a cardboard standee. The direction did not help by giving him a lot of brooding closeups as if by abundance, we can actually see depth into Batman's soul. One peculiar nuance with this new version is Batman is being demystified to become a more common mortal, like the Paul Kersey character in those Death Wish movies for Batman is able to walk among the police of Gotham like Sherlock Holmes could among his bobbies. He is no longer the revered ""dark knight"" but the weird ""vengeance"" guy in a funny costume. Someone whom the police can barely tolerate. Also, new to this is the mystery of his true identity. It is a secret seemingly more important to Bruce than to others. The general curiosity in the matter among people seems perfunctorily halfhearted. My favorite parts in the movie are the detective style of storytelling, especially at the opening. Some of the fight scenes are also quite spectacular and finally, the kit out, stripped down, quasi stock racer of a bat mobile with that bad ass jet engine so exposed as the flaming butt hole of the car. The rawness and the attainableness of the whole design is just delightful.",batman reset batman saga literally top lengthy epic length almost hour long first screen version batman tv series duet boy wonder sidekick dated back squeaky clean version pow kapow knockout bad guy superhero super boy wonder accompaniment maintaining law order suggestively beyond arm gotham police time progress movie version batman took interim turn become bigger fantastic super toy point outgrown need robin boy wonder become super solo design needed offset equally diabolical showy super villain time gotham still simplistically polar good v bad real world evolved complex dualistic sophistry relativism gotham also evolved accordingly batman becomes dark knight longer adam west version dark spot heart vengeance drive justice care puritanically good long shine darkness greater evil latest version line good evil become even le distinguishable become question batman riddler acceptable vigilante question claim moral higher ground question also asked movie seven movie robert pattison make visually compelling batman look spite short fall script character written depth cardboard standee direction help giving lot brooding closeup abundance actually see depth batman soul one peculiar nuance new version batman demystified become common mortal like paul kersey character death wish movie batman able walk among police gotham like sherlock holmes could among bobby longer revered dark knight weird vengeance guy funny costume someone police barely tolerate also new mystery true identity secret seemingly important bruce others general curiosity matter among people seems perfunctorily halfhearted favorite part movie detective style storytelling especially opening fight scene also quite spectacular finally kit stripped quasi stock racer bat mobile bad as jet engine exposed flaming butt hole car rawness attainableness whole design delightful,positive,957
"It's a visually beautiful movie, and there are some decent action scenes. Aside from that, the movie is disappointing because of a host of plot and directorial decisions. First of all, he's supposed to be the world's greatest detective and it took him 45 minutes of the movie to figure out that Falcone might be the rat with wings? Seriously? You went to penguin before falcon for that? The movie drags on largely because the director refused to cut down scenes that were way too long. The endless scenes of Batman walking into rooms while the police look at him are the most egregious examples. The car chase scene with Penguin dragged on far too long (by the way, how do you not arrest him after a car chase where a bunch of people died). Bruce Wayne as a character is a complete waste in the movie. Utterly boring. I can respect not making him a playboy, and aiming for something different but there was nothing remotely interesting about Pattinson's portrayal of him. Pattinson was a good Batman but a dreadful Bruce Wayne. The introduction of Joker at the end was incredibly forced, and it made the final act drag out for no reason. Also, apparently everyone in this film is a worse shot than stormtroopers. The dialogue was wooden and often cliched.

"I will never get those three hours of my life back.A LONG seemingly convoluted story that was actually overly simple and obvious. Pacing was miserable.This film could not decide what it wanted to be. It tries to be an action film and a gritty crime drama as well as some emotional social diatribe. Batman was one moment seemingly invulnerable, the next he was weak and more ""human."" He was built up and also deconstructed. He was a great detective one minute, and a complete idiot the next. Overall, the characters are inconsistent and confusing.Catwoman's character is pointless. She really added nothing to the plot. And the sexual tension between bat and cat seems forced.The monologues and dialogues are just too much. They make a terribly long movie just drag on. The single ""theme"" song repeated over and over and OVER was just monotonous and distracting.Surprisingly Pattinson made a fairly good Batman. However his Bruce Wayne is worse than emo Peter Parker from Spider-Man 3.This is by far the worst Batman film ever made (yes, including Batman forever), and is in the running for worst DC movie (although that is a large field).",never get three hour life back long seemingly convoluted story actually overly simple obvious pacing miserable film could decide wanted try action film gritty crime drama well emotional social diatribe batman one moment seemingly invulnerable next weak human built also deconstructed great detective one minute complete idiot next overall character inconsistent confusing catwoman character pointless really added nothing plot sexual tension bat cat seems forced monologue dialogue much make terribly long movie drag single theme song repeated monotonous distracting surprisingly pattinson made fairly good batman however bruce wayne worse emo peter parker spider man far worst batman film ever made yes including batman forever running worst dc movie although large field,negative,961

"I was excited by this - a kind of Watchmen meets Seven tone seemed right up my alley. The first time I watched it I walked out of the cinema after about 30 minutes, annoyed. Nonetheless, I thought I'd give it a second chance, so went to another screening. I left feeling underwhelmed - the script is predictable to the point of my being able to quote it upon first viewing. The acting is decent despite the shoddy dialogue. The best thing about the movie was the Penguin, who got less screen time than he should have. Overall, I found myself asking 'why do we need this Batman?'.

"Slow motion. That about sums up the worst part of this movie. Countless of times in this movie, simple actions are drawn out to take 10 times as long because the director decided the action of ""Batman picks up a freaking object"" should definitely be done in ultra slow motion.And then there's the overall slow pace of the movie: the dialogue is slow and devoid of depth. It's like the director thought that by making everything slow things, the tension increases... It does NOT if you do it like this. This is one of the most boring movies I've seen in quite a while. The drama is boring, the action is boring, the plot moves at a snail's pace. Batman is clearly utterly invincible in every fight scene, the actual dialogue would make you yawn or roll your eyes even if it took half as long as it does, and about a third of the movie time is wasted on loooooong close-ups of actors' faces staring with a blank expression into nothing (because this is ""artistic"" of course).The plot cannot make up for it.

"I always feel in our ever divisive non nuanced society if something is good it must be a 10 or if it disappoints compared to expectations then it must be a 3 or 4. Both a overly high or low score wouldn't justify judging this movie in my opinion.I'm a mamouth Batman fan and there is so much good stuff like how they captured Gotham perfectly, gave us tons of originality, the score, some great lines and casting... But unfortunately the over scripting, horrid pacing and laborious length hinders this greatly.

"Nah, this isn't as good as ""The Dark Knight"" when it comes to the quality of a film, but it is absolutely the best depiction of Batman and it's world to date. Man the atmosphere of Gotham city is perfectly nailed comparing it to the comics. The grungy/Gothic architecture reminds me of the new 52's Scott snyder run and Lee Bermejo's version. The look of it is a perfect blend of Nolans and Burtons. This versions Batman is absolutely my favorite when it comes to the portrayal and the performance that Robert Pattinson delivers through the cowl. The rest of the cast does a great job also. Especially Collin Farrell as The Penguin, John Turturo as Carmine Falcone, and Jeffrey Wright as Jim Gordon. Also I would be doing a disservice in not mentioning Michael Giacchino score. I loved how it can go from a noir detective vibe immersing me into the investigation that Batman is engaged in to bombastic loud horns and drums in a action set piece. The cinematography is one of the best in comic book films and the theme of the story beautifully hits the right notes when it comes to the character of Batman. The only real negatives is that the writing sort of suffers from cliches, but that's about it in my opinion. Now I just hope the sequel is in good hands and will out do this one in it's own way.

"As Batman walks stylistically toward the camera, silhouetted against the fiery carnage unfolding behind him... The audience thinks 'awesome'. Easily the most visually impressive scene in the film.

We are meant to cheer this? Is it cool? It looked cool, but it was also the perfect depiction of why vigilantes are dangerous and unnecessary.""Unnecessary"", could have been the tagline to this film. Not only does our hero cause the deaths of civilians driving, he also fails to prevent all the antagonist's plans. I mean literally, Batman did nothing to save anyone in this film...

"In a welcome break from standard superhero fare, The Batman drops the high tech gadgets and world saviour schtick of 21st Century superhero genre and gives us a classic stripped-down film noir instead. The acting is great, the direction and screenplay are top notch and there are some excellent action scenes thrown in too.But, be warned, it IS long and will not be to everyone's taste. Much of what we have come to expect of the genre is completely absent, and it's closer in spirit to mid-to-late-90s cinema such as Se7en or Fight Club than 21st Century MCU or DCEU.

"I am very open to visions, I'm super happy for Reeves to have FINALLY had his film released, that Fandome trailer was unbelievable, the castings in this amongst the villains were next level. The film has a beginning that gives an intro to Batman unlike anything we have seen previously, which unfortunately for me was the peak of the film. This film's length is incredibly unnecessary for the simple plot and characters it has, it doesn't need the time to go into any villains' origin story, it only uses it's runtime to take a ridiculously long route to explain the very simple plot it has with very little payoff, the final act is anticlimactic, and really achieves very little the more I think about it. The way Batman and catwoman 'catch feelings' feels so forced and unnatural, I don't buy the romance. Lastly, I was hoping given the trailers and context that this Emo, Hermit Bruce Wayne was only going to be because this specific films 'case' he was working on struck a specific chord in him or that he was really staying up countless hours thinking about this, but no, this really seems to be the Bruce Wayne vibe we have going forward and I don't care for it.",open vision super happy reef finally film released fandome trailer unbelievable casting amongst villain next level film beginning give intro batman unlike anything seen previously unfortunately peak film film length incredibly unnecessary simple plot character need time go villain origin story us runtime take ridiculously long route explain simple plot little payoff final act anticlimactic really achieves little think way batman catwoman catch feeling feel forced unnatural buy romance lastly hoping given trailer context emo hermit bruce wayne going specific film case working struck specific chord really staying countless hour thinking really seems bruce wayne vibe going forward care,negative,983

"This comes from a Batman fan over all the other superheroes combined from DC or Marvel. Matt Reeves fails to carry forward the legacy of Dark Knight trilogy(as the Last stand alone Batman films) Let me point out a few major areas where the movie falls behind.1.) The Gotham Politics and Corruption was stated so beautifully in Dark Knight parallel with the storyline of joker that it all makes sense whereas Reeves over exploited it by involving all Crime families of Gotham without nourishing characters with impactful scenes.2.) The Villain, Riddler was a nice set up there's no doubt, the riddles the murders the motive it was all good and commendable but I think they should have kept his identity an enigma or maybe even Batman kill Riddler(maybe accidentally)could have been even better as he didn't have much part in later movie section after he revealed his identity and that would have left more impact. I know the 'Batman Doesn't Kill' morals but they showed the batman to be an immature superhero with just 2 year superhero life span so it could have been interwoven later in character development and No Kill morals later on in successive parts.3.) The storyline and the Pace of the movie was ridiculously off setting. I do like watching long movies with proper character development and slowly progressive storyline into an intense showdown at the end but it was missing in batman. They could have easily trimmed the movie half hour without offending directors vision for the movie because there was little to the motive of many sequences shown and they were simply not integral with storyline and could have been trimmed off.The Good : A vulnerable Batman was a delight to watch with all the fist fight and less of gadget showoff, it was just commendable how the hero was projected to be 'one of us'. Reeves really cracked the shell for batman for upcoming sequels showing how he makes mistakes and learn from them it was something never shown before on big screen. And the Catwoman ofcourse was a treat to the eyes with a backup story and character development.",come batman fan superheroes combined dc marvel matt reef fails carry forward legacy dark knight trilogy last stand alone batman film let point major area movie fall behind gotham politics corruption stated beautifully dark knight parallel storyline joker make sense whereas reef exploited involving crime family gotham without nourishing character impactful scene villain riddler nice set doubt riddle murder motive good commendable think kept identity enigma maybe even batman kill riddler maybe accidentally could even better much part later movie section revealed identity would left impact know batman kill moral showed batman immature superhero year superhero life span could interwoven later character development kill moral later successive part storyline pace movie ridiculously setting like watching long movie proper character development slowly progressive storyline intense showdown end missing batman could easily trimmed movie half hour without offending director vision movie little motive many sequence shown simply integral storyline could trimmed good vulnerable batman delight watch fist fight le gadget showoff commendable hero projected one u reef really cracked shell batman upcoming sequel showing make mistake learn something never shown big screen catwoman ofcourse treat eye backup story character development,positive,999
"Waited for ever to see this movie. The plot was all over the place . No proper sequence of events. Everything felt random. No connection with the characters . Not many impressive dialogues. Maybe a few. A few good action scenes, maybe The penguin car chase. Not much chemistry between catwoman and batz. They caught the riddler so easily , there was no build up. They showed the detective side of batz well, that's one of the few things I liked . Good trailer of a bad movie . Total waste of time . This worse than George Clooney Batman movie . Robert Patt may played Batman well but he was no Bruce Wayne .",waited ever see movie plot place proper sequence event everything felt random connection character many impressive dialogue maybe good action scene maybe penguin car chase much chemistry catwoman batz caught riddler easily build showed detective side batz well one thing liked good trailer bad movie total waste time worse george clooney batman movie robert patt may played batman well bruce wayne,positive,1000
